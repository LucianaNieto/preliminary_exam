Even so, drivers of soil C total and labile pools are little understood for smallholder farms. A unique opportunity to evaluate how environment conditions management drivers was afforded by a systematically representative on-farm study of 1108 cultivated plots in marginal to mesic environments across Central and Southern Malawi. Soil sample collection and analysis and surveys of farmer practice were conducted, and linked to remote-sensed data on environmental and spectral factors. Soil properties included the following ranges (mean values per site), soil clay (6.41% to 17.36%), pH (6.09 to 6.54), soil organic carbon (SOC) (6.31 g C kg soil-1 to 16.17 g C kg soil-1), and two labile soil C assays: permanganate oxidizable carbon (POXC) (291.5 mg C kg soil-1 to 504.5 mg C kg soil-1) and 24-h mineralizable C (Cmin) (28.71 mg C kg soil-1 to 65.34 mg C kg soil-1). Incorporation of domain specialists' expectation of uncertainty levels is key to carrying out a multiscale assessment of soil total and labile C status, thus a Bayesian linear regression approach was used for determining the influential drivers. Overall, the soil clay content is a strong predictor of SOC (0.479-0.517), POXC (0.139-0.266), and Cmin (0.125-0.223) at the 95% Bayesian credibility level from the Gibbs posterior samples. Vegetative cover, reflected by Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), is also a dominant driver for SOC (0.234-0.329), POXC (0.163-0.285), and Cmin (0.249-0.38). Of the management practices studied, crop diversity, residue incorporation, and weed presence are all positive drivers for total soil C, whereas fertilizer N is not. At both regional and local scales, labile soil C pools (as reflected by POXC and Cmin) are not consistently responsive to management. The drivers of SOC are highly consistent, a strong indication of statistical robustness. This contributes to the understanding of patterns of carbon pools in intensively cultivated fields in Sub-Saharan Africa.","[Tu, Xinyi; Snapp, Sieglinde] Michigan State Univ, Dept Pant Soil & Microbial Sci, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Tu, Xinyi] Michigan State Univ, Environm Sci & Policy Program, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Viens, Frederi] Michigan State Univ, Dept Stat & Probabil, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Viens, Frederi] Michigan State Univ, Actuarial Sci Program, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",,"Tu, XY (corresponding author), Michigan State Univ, 1066 Bogue St,A286 Plant & Soil Sci Bldg, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",tuxinyi1@gmail.com,"Snapp, Sieglinde/AAU-8121-2020","Snapp, Sieglinde/0000-0002-9738-0649",United States Agency for International Development (USAID) [AID-OAA-A-13-00006]; International Institute of Tropical Agriculture; Michigan State University; USAID [AID-BFS-IO-15-00001],United States Agency for International Development (USAID)(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)CGIAR); International Institute of Tropical Agriculture(CGIAR); Michigan State University; USAID(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)),"This study was funded by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID, Grant AID-OAA-A-13-00006) as part of the US Governments Feed the Future Initiative funded project entitled Africa RISING (Research in Sustainable Intensification for the Next Generation) with support from International Institute of Tropical Agriculture.

Using remote sensing and inventory data, this study provides a comprehensive record of FCC, WH, and their integrated carbon emissions between 1908 and 2015 in the dry temperate regions of Pakistan. Results demonstrate a significant decline in forest area (21,034 ha) at an annual rate of 0.56% from 1973 to 2015. The total WH was 24.84 million m(3) (0.23 million m(3) yr(-1)) between 1908 and 2015. Deforestation was responsible for a net loss of 1.39 million Mg C (0.018 million Mg C yr(-1)), while WH-related carbon emissions accounted for 11.29 million Mg C (0.52 million Mg C yr(-1)). The present results indicate that under the existing FCC and WH harvest scenario, the forests are acting as a net source of 0.29 million Mg C yr(-1). Agriculture expansion and the heavy dependency of local communities on the forest's resources, exclusion of conservation and local communities from forest management, insufficient monitoring, and weak law-enforcement were the striking drivers of FCC, WH, and their related emissions. These findings suggest that to maintain forest carbon and meet the communities' requirements, counter approaches such as agriculture incentives, agroforestry, trophy hunting, alternative energy sources, and inclusion of conservation and secure community-based management are needed.","[Ahmad, Adnan; Khalid, Faisal] Inst Space Technol, Natl Ctr GIS & Space Applicat, GIS & Space Applicat Geosci G SAGL Lab, Islamabad, Pakistan; [Ahmad, Adnan; Zeb, Alam; Rajpar, Muhammad Nawaz; Ullah, Sami; Khalid, Faisal] Shaheed Benazir Bhutto Univ, Fac Life Sci, Dept Forestry, Peshawar, Pakistan; [Ahmad, Adnan; Liu, Qijing] Beijing Forestry Univ, Coll Forestry, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Ahmad, Shahid; Nabi, Ghulam] Hebei Normal Univ, Coll Life Sci, Key Lab Anim Physiol, Biochem & Mol Biol Hebei Prov, Shijiazhuang, Peoples R China; [Rahman, Mujibur] Beijing Forestry Univ, Sch Soil & Water Conservat, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zu, Kuiling] Peking Univ, Inst Ecol, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Key Lab Earth Surface Proc Minist Educ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Guo, Xinle] Qinghai Normal Univ, Coll Life Sci, Xining, Peoples R China; [Guo, Xinle] Qinghai Normal Univ, Acad Plateau Sci & Sustainabil, Xining, Peoples R China; [Wanghe, Kunyuan] Chinese Acad Sci, Northwest Inst Plateau Biol, Key Lab Adaptat & Evolut Plateau Biota, Qinghai Prov Key Lab Anim Ecol Genom, Xining, Qinghai, Peoples R China",,"Nabi, G (corresponding author), Hebei Normal Univ, Coll Life Sci, Key Lab Anim Physiol, Biochem & Mol Biol Hebei Prov, Shijiazhuang, Peoples R China.;Wanghe, K (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Northwest Inst Plateau Biol, Key Lab Adaptat & Evolut Plateau Biota, Qinghai Prov Key Lab Anim Ecol Genom, Xining, Qinghai, Peoples R China.",ghulamnabiqau@gmail.com; wanghekunyuan@189.cn,,,Natural Science Foundation of Qinghai Province [2022-ZJ-936Q],Natural Science Foundation of Qinghai Province,This work was supported by Natural Science Foundation of Qinghai Province (2022-ZJ-936Q).,,43,0,0,1,1,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2296-665X,,FRONT ENV SCI-SWITZ,Front.

Agroecosystem models are generally used to assess cropland carbon fluxes because of their ability to capture the complex interactive effects of factors influencing carbon balance. For regional carbon flux simulations, generally gridded climate data sets are used because they offer data for each grid cell of the region of interest. However, studies consistently report uncertainties in climate datasets, which affect the accuracy of carbon flux simulations. OBJECTIVE: The objectives were to 1) determine the uncertainties in daily weather variables of commonly used high resolution gridded climate datasets in the U.S (NARR, NLDAS, Prism and Daymet); 2) estimate their impact on the accuracy of simulated Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE) under irrigated and non-irrigated corn and soybeans using the Environmental Policy Integrated Climate (EPIC) agroecosystem model, and 3) understand the relative sensitivity of the NEE to various climate variables. METHODS: The observational data at four flux tower cropland sites in the U.S Midwest region were used to quantify the uncertainties in the gridded weather datasets, and EPIC simulations were performed at each flux tower site using each gridded climate dataset. Further, sensitivity analysis using Extended Fourier Amplitude Sensitivity Test (EFAST) was conducted. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that daily weather variables in all gridded climate datasets display some degree of bias, leading to considerable uncertainty in simulated NEE. The gridded climate datasets produced based on interpolation techniques (i.e. Daymet and Prism) were shown to have less uncertainties, and resulted in NEE estimates with relatively higher accuracy, likely due to their higher spatial resolution and higher dependency on meteorological station observations. The Mean Absolute Percentage Errors (MAPE) values of average growing season NEE estimates for Dayment, Prism, NLDAS and NARR include 22.53%, 23.45%, 62.52% and 66.18%, respectively. The NEE under irrigation (MAPE = 53.15%) tends to be more sensitive to uncertainties compared to the fluxes under non-irrigation (MAPE = 34.19%). Further, this study highlights that NEE responds differently to the individual climate variables and management. Under irrigation management, NEE are more sensitive to temperature. Conversely, under non-irrigation, precipitation is the most dominant factor influencing NEE uncertainty. SIGNIFICANCE: These findings demonstrate that careful consideration is necessary when selecting climate data to mitigate uncertainties in simulated NEE. Further, alternative approaches such as integration of remote sensing data products may help reduce the models' dependency on climate datasets and improve the accuracy in the simulated CO2 fluxes.","[Bandaru, Varaprasad] Univ Maryland, Dept Geog Sci, College Pk, MD 20742 USA",,"Bandaru, V (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, Dept Geog Sci, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",vbandaru@umd.edu,,,NASA Carbon Monitoring System program [80NSSC21K0968],NASA Carbon Monitoring System program,"This work is partly supported by NASA Carbon Monitoring System program (grant no: 80NSSC21K0968).

The present study was conducted on the Tawdeehiya Farms, located in the central region of Saudi Arabia between Al-Kharj and Haradh cities. Methodology: Landsat-8 (L8) and Sentinel-2 (S2A) satellite images were used for the characterization of SOC stocks in the topsoil layer (0-10 cm) of the experimental fields. Soil samples were randomly collected from six (50 ha each) agricultural fields and analyzed in the laboratory for SOC (SOCA) following Walkley and Black method. While, vegetation indices (VI), such as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), NDVIRedEdge, Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), Bare Soil Index (BSI), and Reduced Simple Ratio (RSR) were computed and subsequently used for the development of SOC prediction models. Results: Univariate linear regression technique was employed for the recognition of a suitable band/VI for SOC (SOCP) mapping. The SWIR-1 band of both L8 (R-2 = 0.86) and S2A (R2 = 0.77) data was promising for predicting SOC with 16% (S2A) and 18% (L8) of BIAS. Interpretation: The NDVI and BSI (for L8 data) and BSI and RSR (for S2A data) were found most suitable VI in the prediction of SOC. The R-2 values of linear regression models were 0.68 (BSI) and 0.78 (RSR), indicating that nearly 68% and 78% of the SOC could be predicted through L8 and S2A datasets, respectively.","[Madugundu, R.; Al-Gaadi, K.

Using Landsat data to characterize cropland albedos in Canada's three prairie soil zones, this study estimates the atmospheric carbon equivalent drawdown of albedo radiative forcing for three management practices: 1) moving from conventional tillage to no-till, 2) eliminating summer fallow in crop rotations, and 3) growing crops with higher albedos. In a 50-year time horizon, conversion from conventional tillage to no-till results in a total equivalent atmospheric CO2 (CO2-eq) drawdown of 1.0-1.5 kg m(-2), and conversion from summer fallow to crops results in CO2-eq drawdown of 1.1-2.4 kg m(-2). Conversion of summer fallow to crops results in different magnitudes of CO2-eq drawdown depending on specific crops. Lentils, peas, and canola have relatively higher albedo than that of spring wheat and flax; hence, a larger magnitude of CO2-eq drawdown results when they replace summer fallow in the rotation. For the management changes from 1990 to 2019 for the whole Canadian Prairies, albedo changes induced a CO2-eq drawdown of about 179.3 +/- 20.9 Tg due to increased area of no-till, and 101.6 +/- 9.5 Tg due to reduced area under fallow. The study shows that the magnitudes of CO2-eq drawdown due to albedo change are comparable to that due to soil carbon sequestration. Therefore, it is important to account for cropland albedo changes in assessing the potential of agricultural management practices to mitigate climate change.","[Liu, Jiangui; Desjardins, Raymond L.; Worth, Devon E.; Qian, Budong; Shang, Jiali] Agr & Agri Food Canada, Ottawa Res & Dev Ctr, Ottawa, ON K1A 0C6, Canada; [Wang, Shusen] Nat Resources Canada, Canada Ctr Remote Sensing, Ottawa, ON K1A 0E6, Canada",,"Liu, JG; Desjardins, RL (corresponding author), Agr & Agri Food Canada, Ottawa Res & Dev Ctr, Ottawa, ON K1A 0C6, Canada.",Jiangui.liu@agr.gc.ca; Ray.desjardins@agr.gc.ca,,"Liu, Jiangui/0000-0003-3560-4034",,,,,72,1,1,2,12,ACADEMIC PRESS LTD- ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,LONDON,"24-28 OVAL RD, LONDON NW1 7DX, ENGLAND",0301-4797,1095-8630,,J ENVIRON MANAGE,J.

In this paper, 225 soil samples were studied. The effects of different water treatments on soil organic carbon (SOC) content, and the relationship between SOC content and spectral reflectance (350-2500 nm) were studied. 17 kinds of preprocessing algorithm were performed on the original spectral (R), and the five allocation ratios of calibration to verification sets were set. Finally, the model was constructed by partial least squares regression (PLSR). The results showed that the effects of water treatment on SOC content were different in different growth stages of winter wheat. Results of correlation analysis showed that the differential transformation can refine the spectral characteristics, and improve the correlation between SOC content and spectral reflectance. Results of model construction showed that the models constructed by second-order differential transformation were not good. But the ratio of standard deviation to the standard prediction error (RPD) values of the models were constructed by simple mathematical transformation (T0-T5) and first-order differential transformation (T6-T11) can reach more than 1.4.

Generally, the most commonly used covariates (MCC; e.g., topographic attributes and single-time remote sensing data, and legacy maps) were employed in DSM studies. Additionally, remote sensing time-series (RST) data can provide useful information for soil mapping. Therefore, the main aims of the study are to compare the MCC, the monthly Sentinel-2 time-series of vegetation indices dataset, and the combination of datasets (MCC + RST) for soil organic carbon (SOC) prediction in an arid agroecosystem in Iran. We used different machine learning algorithms, including random forest (RF), Cubist, support vector machine (SVM), and partial least square regression (PLSR). A total of 237 soil samples at 0-20 cm depths were collected. The 5-fold cross-validation technique was used to evaluate the modeling performance, and 50 bootstrap models were applied to quantify the prediction uncertainty. The results showed that the Cubist model performed the best with the MCC dataset (R-2 = 0.35, RMSE = 0.26%) and the combined dataset of MCC and RST (R-2 = 0.33, RMSE = 0.27%), while the RF model showed better results for the RST dataset (R-2 = 0.10, RMSE = 0.31%). Soil properties could explain the SOC variation in MCC and combined datasets (66.35% and 50.82%, respectively), while NDVI was the most controlling factor in the RST (50.22%). Accordingly, results showed that time-series vegetation indices did not have enough potential to increase SOC prediction accuracy. However, the combination of MCC and RST datasets produced SOC spatial maps with lower uncertainty. Therefore, future studies are required to explicitly explain the efficiency of time-series remotely-sensed data and their interrelationship with environmental covariates to predict SOC in arid regions with low SOC content.","[Zeraatpisheh, Mojtaba; Xu, Ming] Henan Univ, Henan Key Lab Earth Syst Observat & Modeling, Kaifeng 475004, Peoples R China; [Zeraatpisheh, Mojtaba; Xu, Ming] Henan Univ, Coll Geog & Environm Sci, Kaifeng 475004, Peoples R China; [Garosi, Younes; Ayoubi, Shamsollah] Isfahan Univ Technol, Coll Agr, Dept Soil Sci, Esfahan 8415683111, Iran; [Owliaie, Hamid Reza] Univ Yasuj, Coll Agr, Yasuj, Iran; [Taghizadeh-Mehrjardi, Ruhollah; Scholten, Thomas] Univ Tubingen, Dept Geosci Soil Sci & Geomorphol, D-72070 Tubingen, Germany; [Taghizadeh-Mehrjardi, Ruhollah; Scholten, Thomas] Univ Tubingen, SFB 1070 ResourceCultures, Gartenstr 29, D-72074 Tubingen, Germany; [Taghizadeh-Mehrjardi, Ruhollah; Scholten, Thomas] Univ Tubingen, DFG Cluster Excellence Machine Learning, Tubingen, Germany",,"Xu, M (corresponding author), Henan Univ, Henan Key Lab Earth Syst Observat & Modeling, Kaifeng 475004, Peoples R China.;Xu, M (corresponding author), Henan Univ, Coll Geog & Environm Sci, Kaifeng 475004, Peoples R China.",mojtaba.zeraatpisheh@henu.edu.cn; owliaie@yu.ac.ir; ayoubi@cc.iut.ac.ir; ruhollah.taghizadeh-mehrjardi@mnf.uni-tuebingen.de; thomas.scholten@uni-tuebingen.de; mingxu@henu.edu.cn,"Owliaie, Hamidreza/AAE-1179-2022; Zeraatpisheh, Mojtaba/V-1244-2018; Taghizadeh, Ruhollah/H-3682-2013","Zeraatpisheh, Mojtaba/0000-0001-7209-0744; Taghizadeh, Ruhollah/0000-0002-4620-6624","National Key Research and Development Program of China [2017YFA0604302, 2018YFA0606500]; Isfahan University of Technology; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) under Germany's Excellence Strategy -EXC [2064/1, 390727645, SFB 1070, 215859406]","National Key Research and Development Program of China; Isfahan University of Technology; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) under Germany's Excellence Strategy -EXC(German Research Foundation (DFG))","Mojtaba Zeraatpisheh's postdoctoral program at Henan University, China, has been supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China, grant numbers 2017YFA0604302 and 2018YFA0606500.

Precise and robust prediction of SOC greatly contributes to carbon neutrality in the agricultural industry. To create more knowledge regarding the ability of remote sensing to monitor carbon soil, this research devises a state-of-the-art low cost machine learning model for quantifying agricultural soil carbon using active and ensemble-based decision tree learning combined with multi-sensor data fusion at a national and world scale. This work explores the use of Sentinel-1 (S1) C-band dual polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (SAR), Sentinel-2 (S2) multispectral data, and an innovative machine learning (ML) approach using an integration of active learning for land-use mapping and advanced Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) for robustness of the SOC estimates. The collected soil samples from a field survey in Western Australia were used for the model validation. The indicators including the coefficient of determination (R-2) and root - mean - square - error (RMSE) were applied to evaluate the model's performance. A numerous features computed from optical and SAR data fusion were employed to build and test the proposed model performance. The effectiveness of the proposed machine learning model was assessed by comparing with the two well-known algorithms such as Random Forests (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) to predict agricultural SOC. Results suggest that a combination of S1 and S2 sensors could effectively estimate SOC in farming areas by using ML techniques. Satisfactory accuracy of the proposed XGBoost with optimal features was achieved the highest performance (R-2 = 0.870; RMSE - 1.818 tonC/ha) which outperformed RF and SVM. Thus, multi-sensor data fusion combined with the XGBoost lead to the best prediction results for agricultural SOC at 10 m spatial resolution. In short, this new approach could significantly contribute to various agricultural SOC retrieval studies globally. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Recent developments in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) combined with miniaturized visible-near infrared spectrometers have enabled the rapid and low-cost field-scale SOC mapping. However, a field-specific spectrotransfer model is often needed for such UAV-based hyperspectral measurements, implying local sampling and model development are still required, and this hampers the widespread application of UAV-based methods. In this study, we aim to test to what extent SOC prediction models derived from an existing regional soil spectral library (SSL) can be applied to UAV-based hyperspectral data, without the need for additional field sampling. To this end, an UAV survey was conducted over a bare cropland within the Belgian Loam Belt for field-scale SOC mapping. We evaluated two calibration approaches, one based on local sampling and model development, and one where we capitalized on an existing (laboratory-based) regional SSL. For the local calibration approach, we obtained a good prediction performance with RMSE of 0.57 g kg(-1) and RPIQ of 2.35. For the regional model, a spectral alignment procedure was needed to resolve the discrepancy between UAV- and laboratory-based measurements. This resulted in a fair SOC prediction accuracy with RMSE of 0.93 g kg(-1) and RPIQ of 1.45. The comparison of SOC maps derived from the two approaches, along with an external validation showed a high consistency, indicating that UAV-based spectral measurements, in combination with SSLs have the potential to improve the efficiency of high-resolution SOC mapping.","[Zhang, He; Shi, Pu; Crucil, Giacomo; van Wesemael, Bas; Van Oost, Kristof] UC Louvain, Georges Lemaitre Ctr Earth & Climate Res, Earth & Life Inst, B-1348 Louvain La Neuve, Belgium; [Limbourg, Quentin] Walloon Agr Res Ctr CRA W, Farming Syst Terr & Informat Technol Unit, Gembloux, Belgium",,"Zhang, H (corresponding author), UC Louvain, Georges Lemaitre Ctr Earth & Climate Res, Earth & Life Inst, B-1348 Louvain La Neuve, Belgium.",he.zhang@uclouvain.be,,"Zhang, He/0000-0003-0328-1445; Shi, Pu/0000-0002-1792-2445",Belgian Federal Science Policy Office [SR/00/362]; China Scholarship Council [201706300034],Belgian Federal Science Policy Office(Belgian Federal Science Policy OfficeEuropean Commission); China Scholarship Council(China Scholarship Council),"Belgian Federal Science Policy Office, Grant/ Award Number: SR/00/362; China Scholarship Council, Grant/Award Number: 201706300034",,43,1,1,8,25,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1085-3278,1099-145X,,LAND DEGRAD DEV,Land Degrad.

Although significant efforts have been made in modeling the carbon cycle dynamics over this area, large uncertainty still exists in the previous simulations in terms of reproducing individual components of the carbon cycle and their responses to environmental variability. Here we evaluated the performance of an advanced agroecosystem model, ecosys, in simulating carbon budgets over the U.S. Midwest, considering both the magnitude of carbon flux/yield and its response to environmental (climate and soil) variability. We conducted model simulations and evaluations at 7 cropland eddy-covariance sites as well as over 293 counties of Illinois, Indiana, and Iowa in the U.S. Midwest. The site-level simulations showed that ecosys captured both the magnitude and seasonal patterns of carbon fluxes (i.e., net ecosystem carbon exchange (NEE), ecosystem gross primary production (GPP), and ecosystem respiration (Reco)), leaf area index (LAI), and dynamic plant carbon allocation processes, with R-2 equal to 0.92, 0.87, 0.87, and 0.78 for GPP, NEE, Reco, and LAI, respectively across all the sites compared with the observations. For regional scale simulations, ecosys reproduced the spatial distribution and interannual variability of corn and soybean yields with the constraints of observed yields and a new remotely sensed GPP product, with R2 of multi-year averaged simulated and observed yield equal 0.83 and 0.80 for corn and soybean, respectively. The simulated responses of carbon cycle dynamics to environmental variability were consistent with that from the empirical observations at both site and regional scales. Our results demonstrated the applicability of ecosys in simulating the carbon cycle and soil carbon dynamics of the U.S. Midwestern agroecosystems under different climate and soil conditions.","[Zhou, Wang; Guan, Kaiyu; Peng, Bin; Jiang, Chongya] Univ Illinois, Agroecosyst Sustainabil Ctr, Inst Sustainabil Energy & Environm, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Zhou, Wang; Guan, Kaiyu; Peng, Bin; Jiang, Chongya] Univ Illinois, Coll Agr Consumer & Environm Sci, Dept Nat Resources & Environm Sci, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Guan, Kaiyu; Peng, Bin] Univ Illinois, Natl Ctr Supercomp Applicat, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Tang, Jinyun] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Earth & Environm Sci Area, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Jin, Zhenong] Univ Minnesota, Dept Bioprod & Biosyst Engn, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Grant, Robert; Mezbahuddin, Symon] Univ Alberta, Dept Renewable Resources, Edmonton, AB T6G2E3, Canada; [Mezbahuddin, Symon] Alberta Agr & Forestry, Nat Resource Management Branch, Edmonton, AB, Canada",,"Zhou, W; Guan, KY; Peng, B (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Agroecosyst Sustainabil Ctr, Inst Sustainabil Energy & Environm, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.;Zhou, W; Guan, KY; Peng, B (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Coll Agr Consumer & Environm Sci, Dept Nat Resources & Environm Sci, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.;Guan, KY; Peng, B (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Natl Ctr Supercomp Applicat, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",wangzhou@illinois.edu; kaiyug@illinois.edu; binpeng@illinois.edu,,,National Science Foundation (NSF) Career Award [1847334]; Foundation for Food and Agriculture Research (FFAR) [602757]; DOE Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E) SMARTFARM program [DE-FOA-0002250]; NASA Carbon Monitoring System Program [80NSSC18K0170]; USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) Program [2017-67013-26253]; Department of Energy (DOE) [25-1215-0208-006],National Science Foundation (NSF) Career Award(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Office of the Director (OD)); Foundation for Food and Agriculture Research (FFAR); DOE Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E) SMARTFARM program(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); NASA Carbon Monitoring System Program; USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) Program; Department of Energy (DOE)(United States Department of Energy (DOE)),"Authors acknowledge the support from the National Science Foundation (NSF) Career Award (1847334), the Foundation for Food and Agriculture Research (FFAR) (Grant ID: 602757), DOE Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E) SMARTFARM program (DEFOA-0002250), NASA Carbon Monitoring System Program (80NSSC18K0170), USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) Program (2017-67013-26253 and Hatch), and Department of Energy (DOE) (25-1215-0208-006).

While soil maps exist in Saskatchewan, they are at coarse scales (1:100,000), which are not always suitable for detailed soil management. One emerging technique for predictive soil mapping is the use of bare soil composite imagery derived from multi-temporal satellite imagery. This study focused on using bare soil composite imagery along with legacy soil data (1958-1998) with high location uncertainty to predict soil organic carbon, clay, and cation exchange capacity. The bare soil composite images were created from Landsat 5 imagery (1985 to 1995) using Google Earth Engine. Predictive models were built using a Random Forest model for each parameter and evaluated using a 75-25 train-test split. The soil organic carbon model had an R-2 value of 0.55 with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.67 percent, with the near infrared and visible light bands being the most important features in the model. The clay predictive model has an R-2 of 0.44 and a RMSE of 5.0 percent, with the shortwave infrared bands being most important. The cation exchange capacity model had an R-2 of 0.50 with a RMSE of 5.7 meq 100 g(-1), with the shortwave and near infrared bands as the most important predictors. Based on these results, bare soil composite imagery represents a valuable covariate for predictive soil mapping in the Canadian Prairies. This work also illustrates that for regions with extensive adoption of conservation farming practices, satellite imagery should be obtained for time periods before these practices were adopted from the months of the year where crop residues have decomposed. By combining historical soil survey data with historical imagery, maps of legacy soil properties can be generated to make comparisons against with modern data for applications such as monitoring soil organic carbon change over time.","[Sorenson, P.

When SOC changes is estimated with legacy data, the use of soil samples collected in different plots (i.e., non-paired data) may lead to biased results. In the present work, N = 302 georeferenced soil samples were selected from a regional (Sicily, south of Italy) soil database. An operational sampling approach was developed to spot SOC concentration changes from 1994 to 2017 in the same plots at the 0-30 cm soil depth and tested. Results The measurements were conducted after computing the minimum number of samples needed to have a reliable estimate of SOC variation after 23 years. By applying an effect size based methodology, 30 out of 302 sites were resampled in 2017 to achieve a power of 80%, and an alpha = 0.05. A Wilcoxon test applied to the variation of SOC from 1994 to 2017 suggested that there was not a statistical difference in SOC concentration after 23 years (Z = - 0.556; 2-tailed asymptotic significance = 0.578). In particular, only 40% of resampled sites showed a higher SOC concentration than in 2017. Conclusions This finding contrasts with a previous SOC concentration increase that was found in 2008 (75.8% increase when estimated as differences of 2 models built with non-paired data), when compared to 1994 observed data (Z = - 9.119; 2-tailed asymptotic significance < 0.001). This suggests that the use of legacy data to estimate SOC concentration dynamics requires soil resampling in the same locations to overcome the stochastic model errors. Further experiment is needed to identify the percentage of the sites to resample in order to align two legacy datasets in the same area.","[Schillaci, Calogero; Perego, Alessia; Acutis, Marco] Univ Milan, Dept Agr & Environm Sci, I-20133 Milan, Italy; [Saia, Sergio] Univ Pisa, Dept Vet Sci, Via Piagge 2, I-56129 Pisa, Italy; [Lipani, Aldo] Univ Coll London UCL, Dept Civil Environm & Geomat Engn, Gower St, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Zaccone, Claudio] Univ Verona, Dept Biotechnol, Str Le Grazie 15, I-37134 Verona, Italy",,"Schillaci, C (corresponding author), Univ Milan, Dept Agr & Environm Sci, I-20133 Milan, Italy.",calogero.schillaci@unimi.it,"Zaccone, Claudio/A-8568-2008; Lipani, Aldo/H-6258-2019; Schillaci, Calogero/I-4759-2019; Saia, Sergio/K-7535-2012; Acutis, Marco/E-9722-2010","Zaccone, Claudio/0000-0003-4391-354X; Lipani, Aldo/0000-0002-3643-6493; Schillaci, Calogero/0000-0001-7689-5697; Saia, Sergio/0000-0001-5465-8500; Acutis, Marco/0000-0002-1576-8261", [774234],,"The work is partially founded with the H2020 program Landsupport, ID: 774234.",,95,0,0,1,7,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",1750-0680,,,CARBON BAL MANAGE,Carbon Balanc.

The spatial heterogeneity of farmland SOC is not only influence by the environmental factors of soil formation but also the management practices of tillage, fertilization, and irrigation. However, the traditional modeling covariates of digital soil mapping, such as terrain factors, land use types and climate factors have weak spatial variations in low-relief agricultural areas, and they cannot reflect the large spatial variation of SOC. Thus the time-series multispectral remote sensing images will be used for mapping soil properties in low relief regions in this study, meanwhile a new collaborative verification strategy was put forward to evaluate the spatial distribution characteristics of soil maps. The current study was performed in a nearly flat agricultural region southeast of Iowa (with an area of approximately 385.45 ha), where 195 surface soil samples (0-15 cm) were collected. A hyperspectral image (Headwall-Hyperspec, 380-1700 nm) and the time-series multispectral remote sensing images of Sentinel 2 and Landsat 8 were used to construct the prediction models of SOC stock and its relevant soil properties of SOC and soil bulk density (SBD) through partial least square regression (PLSR) and extreme learning machine (ELM) models. The collected soil samples and evaluation indexes of root mean square error (RMSE), R-2, and ratio of performance to interquartile range (RPIQ) were used to evaluate the model performance. Results are as follows: (1) hyperspectral images were successfully used to predict the SOC stock, SOC, and SBD through PLSR and ELM, while ELM (RPIQ = 2.03, 1.97, 1.64) outperformed PLSR (RPIQ = 1.83, 1.97, 1.53); (2) the time-series multispectral remote sensing images of Sentinel 2 and Landsat 8 can reflect the spatial distribution characteristics of the SOC stock, SOC and SBD by PLSR and ELM, but the combination of Sentinel 2 images and ELM obtained the best prediction results (RPIQ = 1.45, 1.25, 1.26); and (3) the differences of the soil maps predicted by the hyperspectral image and time-series multispectral remote sensing images were small, and the largest percentage errors nearly appeared on the edges of the farmland patches owing to mixed pixels. This study further confirmed the good prediction abilities of the time-series multispectral remote sensing images in low relief farmland regions. Lastly, this mapping strategy can provide additional valuable information for agricultural management and carbon cycle.","[Guo, Long; Sun, Xiaoru; Dang, Lina; Zhang, Haitao; Zeng, Chen] Huazhong Agr Univ, Coll Resources & Environm, Wuhan 430070, Peoples R China; [Guo, Long; Sun, Xiaoru; Dang, Lina; Zhang, Haitao; Zeng, Chen] Huazhong Agr Univ, Res Ctr Terr Spatial Governance & Green Dev, Wuhan 430070, Peoples R China; [Fu, Peng] Univ Illinois, Dept Plant Biol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Shi, Tiezhu] Shenzhen Univ, Key Lab Geoenvironm Monitoring Coastal Zone, Natl Adm Surveying Mapping & Geolnformat, Shenzhen 518060, Peoples R China; [Shi, Tiezhu] Shenzhen Univ, Shenzhen Key Lab Spatial Smart Sensing & Serv, Shenzhen 518060, Peoples R China; [Shi, Tiezhu] Shenzhen Univ, Coll Life Sci & Oceanog, Shenzhen 518060, Peoples R China; [Chen, Yiyun] Wuhan Univ, Sch Resource & Environm Sci, Wuhan 430079, Peoples R China; [Linderman, M.] Univ Iowa, Geog & Sustainabil Sci, Iowa City, IA 52246 USA; [Guo, Long; Zhang, Ganlin] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Soil Sci, Nanjing 210008, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Yu] Huazhong Agr Univ, Coll Hort & Forestry Sci, Hubei Engn Technol Res Ctr Forestry Informat, Wuhan 430070, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Qinghu] Chinese Acad Sci, Wuhan Bot Garden, Wuhan 430079, Peoples R China",,"Zhang, HT (corresponding author), Huazhong Agr Univ, Coll Resources & Environm, Wuhan 430070, Peoples R China.;Zhang, HT (corresponding author), Huazhong Agr Univ, Res Ctr Terr Spatial Governance & Green Dev, Wuhan 430070, Peoples R China.;Zhang, Y (corresponding author), Huazhong Agr Univ, Coll Hort & Forestry Sci, Hubei Engn Technol Res Ctr Forestry Informat, Wuhan 430070, Peoples R China.;Jiang, QH (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Wuhan Bot Garden, Wuhan 430079, Peoples R China.",yuzhang@mail.hzau.edu.cn; jiang8687@163.com; zht@mail.hzau.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [41890854, 41771251]; Open Project of the Key Laboratory of Aquatic Plants and Watershed Ecology [Y852721s04]; Independent Technology Innovation Fund of Huazhong Agricultural University [26620208HPY006]; Natural Science Foundation of Hubei [2018CFB372]; Open Project of the MNR Key Laboratory for GeoEnvironmental Monitoring of the Great Bay Area",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Open Project of the Key Laboratory of Aquatic Plants and Watershed Ecology; Independent Technology Innovation Fund of Huazhong Agricultural University; Natural Science Foundation of Hubei(Natural Science Foundation of Hubei Province); Open Project of the MNR Key Laboratory for GeoEnvironmental Monitoring of the Great Bay Area,"This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41890854, 41771251), Open Project of the Key Laboratory of Aquatic Plants and Watershed Ecology (Y852721s04), Independent Technology Innovation Fund of Huazhong Agricultural University (26620208HPY006), Natural Science Foundation of Hubei (2018CFB372), and Open Project of the MNR Key Laboratory for GeoEnvironmental Monitoring of the Great Bay Area.",,65,14,15,22,104,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0016-7061,1872-6259,,GEODERMA,Geoderma,SEP 15,2021,398,,,,,,,115118,10.1016/j.geoderma.2021.115118,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2021.115118,APR 2021,16,Soil Science,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,SL4OT,,,,,2022-08-23

Once the surface vegetation degenerates, it may not be restored. This requires the development of soil organic matter (SOM) monitoring method without destroying the surface, so as to ensure the sustainable development of plateau agriculture. This work investigated the environmental factors that are significantly related to SOM content in the river valley of the southern QTP. These environmental factors include soil hydrothermal factors (soil moisture content and soil temperature), topographic factors (elevation and slope) and vegetation factor (NDVI). The original band reflectivity (OR) of Landsat 8 OLI images and the band reflectivity after the first-order derivative (FDR) and the second-order derivative (SDR) processing were combined with the above environmental factors to estimate SOM content. The results showed that the accuracy of the model was improved obviously by adding environmental factors. The estimation effect of back propagation neural network (BPNN) model was better than that of geographically weighted regression (GWR) model, partial least squares regression (PLSR) model and multivariable linear regression (MLR) model. GWR model can also meet the estimation requirements, while PLSR and MLR models cannot achieve effectively the estimation of SOM content. FDR-BPNN model considering environmental factors was the best model for estimating SOM content, with R2 being 0.947, RMSEC being 4.701 g.kg- 1 and MAEV being 5.485 g.kg 1. Moreover, the model had the lowest uncertainty and the highest stability. This study will provide a good insight for the monitoring of SOM content in the future, and provide basic data support for the implementation of precision agriculture in the QTP.","[Yu, Qing; Yao, Tianci; Lu, Hongwei; Feng, Wei; Xue, Yuxuan; Liu, Binxiao] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Water Cycle & Related Land Surface Proc, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Yu, Qing; Yao, Tianci; Feng, Wei; Xue, Yuxuan; Liu, Binxiao] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China",,"Lu, HW (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Water Cycle & Related Land Surface Proc, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.",luhw@igsnrr.ac.cn,,,Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDA20040301]; Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research Program (STEP) [2019QZKK1003]; National Key Research and Development Program of China [2019YFC0507801],Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences); Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research Program (STEP); National Key Research and Development Program of China,"This research was supported by the Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [Grant No. XDA20040301], the Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research Program (STEP) [Grant No. 2019QZKK1003] and the National Key Research and Development Program of China [Grant No.2019YFC0507801].",,44,4,4,7,26,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0168-1699,1872-7107,,COMPUT ELECTRON AGR,Comput.

In this sense, remote sensing products have shown their power to investigate soil properties, but the assessment of its spatial information can be hampered by the presence of other objects than soil. To overcome this issue, soil scientists have been studying spatial patterns from multi-temporal satellite images aiming at at improving soil property maps. In this work, we applied the cubist algorithm to predict topsoil properties (clay, sand, organic matter and iron contents, and soil color components) in south-eastern Brazil using multi-temporal (Landsat8-OLI, and Sentinel2-MSI) and single-date images (PlanetScope, Landsat8-OLI, and Sentinel2-MSI). We aimed to evaluate the influence of satellite's spatial, spectral and temporal resolutions on soil mapping. Predictive models were constructed with 120 soil samples and using four (vis-NIR) and six (vis-NIR-SWIR) spectral bands as predictors in a 10-fold cross-validation procedure. The multi-temporal image obtained from the Sentinel2-MSI satellite (with 10 m pixel size and six spectral bands), showed the best model performances in cross-validation (R-2 between 0.48 and 0.78). The PlanetScope image, which has only four bands in the vis-NIR region and spatial resolution of 3 m did not improve model performances, although the R-2 values were higher for soil color components (R-2 > 0.5). Satellite images in different spatial, spectral and temporal resolution provides slightly different soil property maps which may promote different strategies regarding soil classification and management. However, satellite images should be used with caution, as they provide only surficial information about the soil variability and confirmation with field surveys is required.","[Silvero, Nelida E.

At regional and global scales, digital mapping of SOC has been successful using environmental variables such as climatic, land use and terrain factors. However, such a mapping for agricultural lands in low-relief areas cannot be resolved due to weak spatial variations of the environmental variables. An alternative approach, based on time series of remote sensing images, has recently been emphasized in estimating SOC since crop growth status clearly revealed by satellite images is strongly related to SOC. However, there is still a lack of full understanding of impacts of factors such as data source, regression techniques, and spatial resolution on the accuracy of SOC mapping using time series of satellite images. In this study, prediction variables including four spectral bands (i.e., blue, green, red, and near-infrared bands) and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) from Sentinel 2, Gaofen (GF) 1, and Landsat 8 data, acquired between November 2017 to March 2018, were individually used to estimate SOC by stepwise regression (STR), partial least squares regression (PLSR), and extreme learning machine (ELM). Besides, we further explored the influence of satellite parameters, such as scanning time, spectral bands and vegetation indices on predicting SOC using Sentinel 2 time series images. Results showed that: (1) the time series of remote sensing images can be used to map SOC in smalland large-extent low-relief areas with low evaluated root mean square errors (0.199 % and 0.249 %) and high R2 (0.555 and 0.528), (2) SOC estimations from the Sentinel-2 time series images, compared to those from Landsat 8 and GF 1 datasets, exhibited a better accuracy, and the ELM yielded a better prediction accuracy than PLSR and STR, (3) the satellite parameters of the spatial resolution, the acquisition time and the spectral bands significantly affected the prediction accuracy. This study offers more comprehensive information than terrain factors for revealing the influence of satellite parameters on predicting SOC, and provides great help for constructing one more suitable and higher precision soil mapping strategy for agricultural lands in low-relief areas.","[Guo, Long; Zeng, Chen; Zhang, Haitao; Wang, Shanqin] Huazhong Agr Univ, Coll Resources & Environm, Wuhan 430070, Peoples R China; [Guo, Long; Zeng, Chen; Zhang, Haitao; Wang, Shanqin] Huazhong Agr Univ, Res Ctr Terr Spatial Governance & Green Dev, Wuhan 430070, Peoples R China; [Fu, Peng] Univ Illinois, Dept Plant Biol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Shi, Tiezhu] Shenzhen Univ, Key Lab Geoenvironm Monitoring Coastal Zone Natl, Shenzhen 518060, Peoples R China; [Shi, Tiezhu] Shenzhen Univ, Shenzhen Key Lab Spatial Smart Sensing & Serv, Shenzhen 518060, Peoples R China; [Shi, Tiezhu] Shenzhen Univ, Coll Life Sci & Oceanog, Shenzhen 518060, Peoples R China; [Chen, Yiyun] Wuhan Univ, Sch Resource & Environm Sci, Wuhan 430079, Peoples R China",,"Wang, SQ (corresponding author), Huazhong Agr Univ, Coll Resources & Environm, Wuhan 430070, Peoples R China.;Wang, SQ (corresponding author), Huazhong Agr Univ, Res Ctr Terr Spatial Governance & Green Dev, Wuhan 430070, Peoples R China.",sqwang@mail.hzau.edu.cn,"Fu, Peng/AAU-2135-2021","Fu, Peng/0000-0003-1568-1518","Independent Technology Innovation Fund of Huazhong Agricultural University [26620208HPY006]; Open project of the Key Laboratory of Aquatic Plants and Watershed Ecology, Chinese Academy of Sciences [Y852721s04]; Natural Science Foundation of Hubei [2018CFB372]; Open project of the MNR Key Laboratory for Geo-Environmental Monitoring of Great Bay Area","Independent Technology Innovation Fund of Huazhong Agricultural University; Open project of the Key Laboratory of Aquatic Plants and Watershed Ecology, Chinese Academy of Sciences; Natural Science Foundation of Hubei(Natural Science Foundation of Hubei Province); Open project of the MNR Key Laboratory for Geo-Environmental Monitoring of Great Bay Area","This research was funded by the Independent Technology Innovation Fund of Huazhong Agricultural University (26620208HPY006), the Open project of the Key Laboratory of Aquatic Plants and Watershed Ecology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (Y852721s04), the Natural Science Foundation of Hubei (2018CFB372), and the DOpen project of the MNR Key Laboratory for Geo-Environmental Monitoring of Great Bay Area.",,81,5,6,18,57,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0167-1987,1879-3444,,SOIL TILL RES,Soil Tillage Res.,JUN,2021,210,,,,,,,104982,10.1016/j.still.2021.104982,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.still.2021.104982,MAR 2021,12,Soil Science,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,RO9KU,,,,,2022-08-23

However, the performances of various GPP models in agroecosystems have been rarely explored. In this study, we calibrated the model parameters and compared the performances of seven light use efficiency (LUE-GPP) models and five vegetation-index (VI-GPP) models for simulating daily GPP of agro-ecosystems over 106 crop growing seasons, and examined the effects of model structure on model performance. The simulations were carried out based on 19 eddy covariance (EC) sites from the global flux network and vegetation indices obtained from MoDIS. The calibrated potential LUE (epsilon(max)) for C-4 crop (summer maize, 2.59 +/- 0.94 g C MJ(-1)) was higher than that for C-3 crops (1.42 +/- 0.58 g C MJ(-)(1)) in any LUE-GPP models. The performances of models differed across the crops. Generally, all models performed better for C-3 crops than C-4 crops, and for winter crops (winter wheat Triticion aestivum L, rape-Bra.ssira napes L, and winter barley-llardeurn vulgare L) than summer crops (summer make-Zea mays L, potato :Solarium tuberosum L, rice-Otyza saliva L. and soybean-Glycine max (L.) Merr.). Cloudiness index-LUE (CI-LUE) model outperformed the other LUE-GPP models, and vegetation index (VEI) model outperformed the other VI-GPP models. LUE-GPP models demonstrated better performance than VI-GPP models due to the inclusion of water stress (W-s) and temperature stress (T-s). A comparison of the model structures showed that models only considering the effects of W-s produced smaller errors than those only considering the effects of T-s in simulating GPP. W-s algorithms generated the larger variations in LUE-GPP models compared to those of T-s especially during the drought period. All models obtained higher R-2 and smaller errors using the minimum method (Min (T-s, W-s)) than using the multiplication method (T-s x W-s) to integrate the effects of T-s and W-s on GPP, which suggested that the minimum method was better than the multiplication method to integrate T-s and W, on LUE. These results showed that satellite-based models with calibrated crop-specific parameters have the potential to serve as the basis for estimation of agroecosystem GPP, and can provide direction for future model structure optimization.","[Jiang, Shouzheng; Zhao, Lu; Liang, Chuan; Cui, Ningbo; Zou, Qingyao] Sichuan Univ, State Key Lab Hydraul & Mt River Engn, Chengdu, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Shouzheng; Zhao, Lu; Liang, Chuan; Cui, Ningbo; Zou, Qingyao] Sichuan Univ, Coll Water Resource & Hydropower, Chengdu 610065, Peoples R China; [Cui, Ningbo; Hu, Xiaotao] Northwest A&F Univ, Key Lab Agr Soil & Water Engn Arid & Semiarid Are, Minist Educ, Yangling, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Gong, Daozhi; Wang, Yaosheng] Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Inst Environm & Sustainable Dev Agr, State Engn Lab Efficient Water Use Crops & Disast, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Feng, Yu] Southern Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Environm Sci & Engn, Shenzhen, Peoples R China",,"Cui, NB (corresponding author), Sichuan Univ, Coll Water Resource & Hydropower, Chengdu 610065, Peoples R China.",cuiningbo@scu.edu.cn,"Wang, Yaosheng/F-9337-2011","Wang, Yaosheng/0000-0002-2657-7057","National Natural Science Foundation of China [51922072, 51779161, 51009101]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2016C DDY-504-SCU, 2017CDLZ-N22, 2018CDPZH-10]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities),"We would like to thank the FLUXNET community including AmeriFlux, AsiaFlux and European Fluxes Database, and all scientists and technicians maintaining the flux site management and providing crop information.

Natural factors such as soil types and topographical factors are important variables in mapping soil properties. Moreover, cropping systems are important components of agricultural activities and are significantly correlated with soil properties. Therefore, integrating cropping systems and natural factors can improve the accuracy of mapping farmland SOCD. This study aimed to obtain and incorporate cropping system information in mapping SOCD in plains by combining normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time-series data and the regression Kriging (RK) method. We collected 230 topsoil samples in Jianghan Plain, China and (i) obtained the spatial patterns of crops in summer and winter using NDVI time-series data derived from HJ-1A/1B satellite images, (ii) investigated the differences in SOCD under different cropping systems, and (iii) evaluated the performance of the RK_CS model in integrating cropping systems and natural factors into mapping SOCD. ANOVA results showed significant differences in SOCD under different cropping systems. Specifically, the SOCD of single rice was higher than that of rice-wheat rotation and dry crops. Meanwhile, the regression results showed that SOCD was affected by natural factors and cropping system, with the latter playing a major role. The integration of soil types, slope and cropping systems explained approximately 26.3% of the variation in SOCD. Model validation results confirmed the effectiveness of the RK_CS model. The findings reveal single cropping rice sequences more C than other cropping systems. Cropping system is an important environmental variable in improving mapping farmland SOCD in plains.

In this study, we combined AGB field survey data and remote sensing data to build a suitable model to estimate the grassland AGB in the Three-River Source Region (TRSR) of China. Three machine learning models were used to simulate the grassland AGB from 2001 to 2019, including support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and high accuracy surface modeling (HASM). The results show that (1) the HASM achieved better results than the RF and SVM models (R-2 = 0.8459 > 0.72 > 0.5858; RMSE = 29 < 41 < 56), and the HASM results reproduce the spatial distribution characteristics of the biomass well. The subsequent spatiotemporal analysis of the AGB conducted in this study was based on the results of the HASM. (2) The highest AGB was located in the eastern and central-southern parts of the TRSR, and the lowest AGB was distributed in the western region. (3) The overall change in the AGB revealed that the percentage of the area that experienced a significant increase in AGB (21%) was larger than that of the area that experienced a significant decrease (13%), and the stable areas accounted for 66% of the total area. The grassland AGB increased by 1 g/m(2)/yr during 2001-2019. (4) The factors driving the changes in the AGB were analyzed. Overall, the warm and wet climate conditions promoted grass growth in most regions of the TRSR. (5) However, the biomass decreased in some regions with warm and wet conditions. For example, overgrazing and increased populations of grazing led to significant biomass decreases in the towns of Ziketang and Heka in Xinghai County. In this study, the grassland AGB was simulated based on the HASM model, with a high accuracy and a spatial resolution of 500 m. The results of this study provide a scientific basis for grassland resource protection and the highly effective implementation of grassland restoration projects in China.","[Zhou, Wei] Southwest Univ, Sch Geog Sci, Chongqing 400715, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Wei; Wang, Zong; Du, Zhengping; Yue, Tianxiang] Chinese Acad Sci, State Key Lab Resources & Environm Informat Syst, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Wei; Li, Haoran; Xie, Lijuan] Chongqing Jiaotong Univ, Dept Geog & Land & Resources, Chongqing 400074, Peoples R China; [Nie, Xuemin] Qinghai Ecol Environm Monitoring Ctr, Xining 810007, Peoples R China",,"Yue, TX (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, State Key Lab Resources & Environm Informat Syst, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.",yue@lreis.ac.cn,,,"China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2019M650821]; Scientific and Technological Research Program of the Chongqing Municipal Education Commission [KJQN201800702]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41977337, 41501575]",China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation); Scientific and Technological Research Program of the Chongqing Municipal Education Commission; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This study was supported by the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (2019M650821), the Scientific and Technological Research Program of the Chongqing Municipal Education Commission (KJQN201800702), and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41977337, 41501575).

Farmland area has been reported to increase despite agriculture's vulnerability to climate variations. This great interplay among land-use dynamics, climate extremes, and food systems is, however, understudied. The current research, therefore, explores this interaction at both national and regional scales for the period between 2001 and 2017. Following an approach that employs remote sensing datasets on Net Primary Productivity (NPP), land cover types, drought indices, and climate variables, i.e. precipitation, temperature, and evapotranspiration, impacts of climate extremes and land cover changes on food production have been analysed. Similarly, the performance of ten major crops in Uganda over the last 6 decades has been detected using the Regime Shift technique. Key findings, thereof, indicate that NPP in farmlands is sensitive to climate variability, and this sensitivity varies spatially among the regions. Forests and permanent wetlands have been massively changed into farmlands, hence, moving a step forward into offsetting food insecurity but a step backward in preserving ecosystem services, espcially mitigating climate change. Furthermore, the noticeable increase in the total production of the major crops in Uganda seems to be derived mainly by the increase in area harvested affirming the step towards food security. However, the influences, thereof, may aggravate climate change impacts especially through reversing carbon sinks into carbon sources. This reversal could impact the crop yields further. Contrastingly, results from some crops illustrate the potential to increase crop production without necessarily expanding the cropland area. Therefore, Uganda may, instead, consider exploiting the maximum yield potential of crops through, for instance, augmenting rainfed agriculture with irrigation and enforcing effective policies rather than expanding farmland area. These findings collectively contribute further to our understanding of the importance of policies that ensure food security but at the same time preserve a healthy environment. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

In this line, satellite images are useful tools that can assist in obtaining soil information from a synoptic point of view. This study aimed at evaluating how satellite images at different resolutions (spatial, spectral and temporal) can influence the representation of soil variability over time, the percentage of bare soil areas and spatial predictions of soil properties in southeastern Brazil. We used single-date and multi-temporal images (SYSI, Synthetic Soil Images) of bare soil pixels from the Sentinel2-MultiSpectral Instrument (S2-MSI) and the Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (L8-OLI) to conduct this research. Two SYSIs were obtained from images acquired in four years (2016-2019) for each satellite (SYSI S2-MSI and SYSI L8-OLI) and a third SYSI, named SYSI Combined, was obtained by combining the images from both satellites. The single date images for each satellite was acquired in September, when the influence of clouds was low and bare soil pixels was predominant. Single-date images and SYSIs were compared by means of their spectral patterns and ability to predict topsoil properties (clay, sand, silt, and organic matter contents and soil color) using the Cubist algorithm. We found that the SYSIs outperformed single-date images and that the SYSI Combined and SYSI L8OLI provided the best prediction performances. The SYSIs also had the highest percentage of areas with bare soil pixels (similar to 30-50%) when compared to the single-date images (similar to 20%). Our results suggest that bare soil images obtained by combining Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 images are more important for soil mapping than spatial or spectral resolutions. Soil maps obtained via satellite images are important tools for soil survey, land planning, management and precision agriculture.","[Quinonez Silvero, Nelida Elizabet; Melo Dematte, Jose Alexandre; Accorsi Amorim, Merilyn Taynara; dos Santos, Natasha Valadares; Rizzo, Rodnei; Safanelli, Jose Lucas; Poppiel, Raul Roberto; Mendes, Wanderson de Sousa; Bonfatti, Benito Roberto] Univ Sao Paulo, Luiz de Queiroz Coll Agr, Sao Paulo, Brazil",,"Dematte, JAM (corresponding author), Univ Sao Paulo, Luiz de Queiroz Coll Agr, Sao Paulo, Brazil.",neli.silvero@usp.br; jamdemat@usp.br; merilyn.accorsi@usp.br; natasha.valadares.santos@usp.br; jose.lucas.safanelli@usp.br; raulpoppiel@usp.br; wandersonsm@usp.br; benito.bonfatti@uemg.br,"Mendes, Wanderson de Sousa/K-9059-2019; Poppiel, Raúl Roberto/R-8128-2019; Demattê, José A.M./I-5990-2013; de Sousa Mendes, Wanderson/F-2905-2017; Silvero, Nelida Elizabet Quinonez/AAK-2209-2021; Safanelli, Jose Lucas/L-7594-2016","Mendes, Wanderson de Sousa/0000-0003-1271-031X; Poppiel, Raúl Roberto/0000-0002-1628-4154; Demattê, José A.M./0000-0001-5328-0323; de Sousa Mendes, Wanderson/0000-0003-1271-031X; Quinonez Silvero, Nelida Elizabet/0000-0001-6021-2759; Safanelli, Jose Lucas/0000-0001-5410-5762; Amorim, Merilyn/0000-0003-4901-6962","National Scholarship Program Don Carlos Antonio Lopez (BECAL) of the Government of Paraguay; Sao Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP) [2014/22262-0, 2016/01597-6]",National Scholarship Program Don Carlos Antonio Lopez (BECAL) of the Government of Paraguay; Sao Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP)(Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP)),"We would like to thank the National Scholarship Program Don Carlos Antonio Lopez (BECAL) of the Government of Paraguay for granting the scholarship to the first author, the Sao Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP) for financial support (Project grant n. 2014/22262-0 and n. 2016/01597-6), the Geotechnologies on Soil Science team -GeoCIS (esalqgeocis.wixsite.com/english) and to everybody that directly or indirectly assisted in publishing this study.",,109,27,27,21,65,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0034-4257,1879-0704,,REMOTE SENS ENVIRON,Remote Sens.

In Xishuangbanna (South-China), rubber is expanding rapidly creating an urgent need to understand and monitor LULC change and how spatial variation affects carbon storage (CS). This is vital for the formation and implementation of better land use management practices. We studied LULC changes of 22-year period; addressing how these changes have affected the CS. We quantified LULC changes between1988 and 2010 using remote sensing methods and calculated CS changes using InvEST. Results showed that between 1988 and 2010, the rate of deforestation accelerated to 203.2 km(2) y(-1) and similar to 23% of forest were lost. Conversion of natural forest to rubber was responsible for 78% of this deforestation. Rubber expansion rate was 153.4 km(2) y(-1). Changes to LULC drove a temporal CS reduction 0.223 Tg C/km(2). Local stakeholders have strong economic interest in converting land to more profitable plantations. Government efforts is required to control land conversion through new policies and incentives to retain natural forest. Assessment of specific potential land use change will be required to avoid promoting the conversion of high carbon storage land uses to low carbon storage land uses.","[Sarathchandra, Chaya] Chinese Acad Sci, Res Ctr Ecoenvironm Sci, State Key Lab Urban & Reg Ecol, Beijing 100085, Peoples R China; [Sarathchandra, Chaya; Worthy, Fiona Ruth; Ma, Huaixia; Bi, Yingfeng; Guo, Jiayu; Chen, Huafang; Xu, Jianchu] Chinese Acad Sci, Kunming Inst Bot, CAS Key Lab Plant Divers & Biogeog East Asia, Kunming 650201, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Sarathchandra, Chaya; Alemu Abebe, Yirga; Ma, Huaixia; Bi, Yingfeng; Guo, Jiayu; Yan, Qiaoshun; Li, Li-Li] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Sarathchandra, Chaya; Lakmali Wijerathne, Iresha; Weragoda, Dayani S.; Wickramasinghe, Sriyani] Rajarata Univ Sri Lanka, Fac Sci Appl, Dept Biol Sci, Mihintale, Sri Lanka; [Alemu Abebe, Yirga] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Semicond, State Key Lab Super Lattices & Microstruct, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Alemu Abebe, Yirga] Hawassa Univ, Inst Technol, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Fac Elect Engn, Hawassa, Ethiopia; [Chen, Huafang; Xu, Jianchu] World Agroforestry Ctr ICRAF, East & Cent Asia Reg Off, Kunming, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Yan, Qiaoshun] Chinese Acad Sci, Ailaoshan Stn Subtrop Forest Ecosyst Studies, Jingdong, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Geng, Yanfei] Guizhou Univ, Coll Tea Sci, Guiyang, Peoples R China; [Weragoda, Dayani S.] Carbon Consulting Co, Colombo, Sri Lanka; [Li, Li-Li] Chinese Acad Sci, Xishuangbanna Trop Bot Garden, Ctr Integrat Conservat, Mengla, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Yang, Fengchun] Yibin Vocat & Tech Coll, Yibin, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Yang, Fengchun] Guangdong Pharmaceut Univ, Sch Chinese Med Mat Resources, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China",,"Sarathchandra, C (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Res Ctr Ecoenvironm Sci, 18 Shuangqing Rd, Beijing 100085, Peoples R China.",chaya@rcees.ac.cn,"Wickramasinghe, Sriyani/AAS-4069-2021; Wijerathne, iresha/AGZ-4002-2022","Wickramasinghe, Sriyani/0000-0002-3193-3386; ",,,,,94,2,3,23,41,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",2096-4129,2332-8878,,ECOSYST HEALTH SUST,Ecosyst.

The 4 per 1000 (4p1000) initiative, launched during the COP 21 in Paris in 2015, based on translating the science of soil carbon sequestration into action at the global scale, is one example of a broader set of negative emission technologies (NETs). While governments and non-governmental organizations are voluntarily implementing the aspirational 4p1000, its adoption and pledges by industry or the private sector is the driving force to accelerate the process of re-carbonization of soil and the terrestrial biosphere. The pledge of achieving carbon (C) neutrality by 2030 or 2050 by some prominent industries is encouraging, and it can serve as a role model for other industries to follow. Adoption of the 4p1000 concept by agro-industries (e.g., fertilizers, pesticides, farm machinery, irrigation, food processing) can promote and accelerate adoption of recommended management practices which create a positive/soil ecosystem carbon budget and enhance C sequestration. This review article describes examples of the emission-neutral concept already adopted by some industries, outlines strategies to promote 4p1000 and NETs, and discusses approaches to advance site-specific NETs. These techniques may include conservation agriculture, cover cropping, precision agriculture, etc., facilitated by artificial intelligence, remote sensing, and robots. Innovative methods of soil sampling as well as remote sensing and mapping of SOC stock are pertinent to promoting NETs and 4p1000. Payments to land managers and farmers for provisioning of ecosystem services through C sequestration in soil and the biosphere can advance the mission of 4p1000. Amongst strategies of encouraging industries to adopt NETs, implementation of a Healthy Soil Act at the state, national, and global level could be a step in the right direction. Market-based economic incentives to industry may be another option to promote adoption of NETs. Similar to U.S. EPA Clean Air Act of 1963 and the U.S. EPA Clean Water Act of 1972, there is a strong need to enact a Healthy Soil Act globally. An effective implementation of the trinity of Acts (air, water, and soil) at the national and global scale will accelerate the process of re-carbonization of the soil and the terrestrial biosphere while also strengthening the provisioning of essential ecosystem services.","[Lal, Rattan] Ohio State Univ, Carbon Management & Sequestrat Ctr, Columbus, OH 43210 USA",,"Lal, R (corresponding author), Ohio State Univ, Carbon Management & Sequestrat Ctr, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",lal.1@osu.edu,"Lal, Rattan/D-2505-2013",,,,,,111,5,5,11,92,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0016-7061,1872-6259,,GEODERMA,Geoderma,NOV 15,2020,378,,,,,,,114613,10.1016/j.geoderma.2020.114613,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2020.114613,,9,Soil Science,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture,NK3SR,,,,,2022-08-23

Measurements of carbon fluxes from agricultural fields using micrometeorological techniques such as eddy covariance can improve our understanding of management and weather-driven changes in carbon budgets. In-situ carbon flux data are also valuable in developing remote sensing-based models for extrapolation of biome-specific carbon budgets to higher spatial scales. In this study, net ecosystem carbon dioxide exchange (NEE) was continuously measured for two years (2017 and 2018) from a cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) field in College Station, Texas, USA. The measured NEE was partitioned into assimilatory (Gross Primary Production, GPP) and respiratory (Ecosystem respiration, R-eco) fluxes. There were substantial differences in carbon fluxes between the two years, which were driven by variations in meteorological conditions and growth of weeds. Due to dry conditions, growing season carbon uptake in 2018 was reduced (883 g C m(-2)) compared to 2017 (947 g C m(-2)). While the growing season of 2018 was dry, the postharvest off-season was remarkably wet with nearly 68% of the annual precipitation occurring after harvest (848 mm). This favored aggressive growth of weeds, resulting in substantial off-season carbon uptake in 2018 (374 g C m(-2) in 2018 compared to 100 g C m(-2) in 2017). Overall, the site was a net carbon source (175 g C m(-2)) in 2017, whereas it was a slight carbon sink (-5 g C m(-2)) in 2018. A significant correlation was found between satellite-derived normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and GPP (R-2 0.78 in 2017 and 0.72 in 2018). Given that correlation, it would be possible to broaden these results to the wider region by estimating GPP with satellite data.","[Menefee, Dorothy; Rajan, Nithya; Bagavathiannan, Muthukumar; Schnell, Ronnie] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Soil & Crop Sci, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Cui, Song] Middle Tennessee State Univ, Sch Agr, Murfreesboro, TN 37130 USA; [West, Jason] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Ecosyst Sci & Management, College Stn, TX USA",,"Rajan, N (corresponding author), Texas A&M Univ, Dept Soil & Crop Sci, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.",nrajan@tamu.edu,"Schnell, Ronnie/AAP-3749-2021","Schnell, Ronnie/0000-0001-6174-9953; West, Jason/0000-0002-7811-8020",National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) [2016-70001-24636]; Cotton Incorporated [17-614]; Planet's Education and Research Program,National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA); Cotton Incorporated(Cotton R&D Corp); Planet's Education and Research Program,"This project was supported by grants from the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) (Grant 2016-70001-24636) and Cotton Incorporated (Grant 17-614).

Within this region, Western Bahia stands out as a large producer of soy and cotton. There are no studies that quantify carbon stocks for different land uses and land cover types in Western Bahia, which hinders comprehension of the role of agricultural expansion in carbon dynamics and the development of sustainable agriculture policies. Here, we evaluate how the land use changes in this region have affected the carbon balance in the aboveground biomass (AGB), belowground biomass (BGB), and soil reservoirs. We collected soil samples for areas with different land uses and land cover types to estimate soil carbon stocks (SCS) and combined remote sensing results and modeling techniques to develop a historical reconstruction of spatial patterns of SCS, AGB, and BGB during the period 1990-2018. The replacement of areas from the forest formations class with pasture and rainfed agriculture reduced the 100 cm depth SCS (SCS100) by 37.3% (p = 0.031) and 30.3% (p = 0.053), respectively. By contrast, the conversion of pasture and rainfed agriculture to irrigated agriculture increased SCS100 by 34% (p = 0.034) and 26.5% (p = 0.022), respectively. Spatial changes in historical carbon stocks are strongly associated with land use changes that occurred between 1990 and 2018. We estimated a non-significant loss of 61.9 Tg-C (p = 0.726) from the total carbon stocks (calculated as the sum of AGB, BGB, and SCS) of which 80% of the losses came from soil stocks, 11% from BGB, and 8% from AGB. These findings reveal the need to monitor carbon stocks in sandy soils to reduce the uncertainties of estimates and support the development of effective sustainable agriculture policies. The best alternatives for reducing carbon losses in the Cerrado are to maintain natural forest cover and to recover soils through sustainable soil management, especially in pasturelands where soil carbon stocks are lowest.","[Dionizio, Emily Ane; Pimenta, Fernando Martins; Lima, Lucas Barbosa; Costa, Marcos Heil] Fed Univ Vicosa UFV, Dept Agr Engn, Vicosa, MG, Brazil",,"Dionizio, EA (corresponding author), Fed Univ Vicosa UFV, Dept Agr Engn, Vicosa, MG, Brazil.",emilyy.ane@gmail.com,"Pimenta, Fernando Martins/B-3819-2014","Pimenta, Fernando Martins/0000-0002-7589-5721; Dionizio da Silva, Emily Ane/0000-0002-1925-1809","PRODEAGRO [011/2016, 045/2019]; Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior-Brasil (CAPES) [001]",PRODEAGRO; Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior-Brasil (CAPES)(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)),This research was funded by PRODEAGRO grants 011/2016 and 045/2019.

However, there is a lack of tools based on objective observations for assessing cropland C budgets at the plot scale over large areas. Such tools would allow us to more precisely establish the contribution of an agricultural plot to net CO2 emissions according to the plot management and identify levers for improving the C budget. In this study, we present a diagnostic regional modelling approach, called SAFY-CO2, that assimilates high spatial and temporal resolution (HSTR) optical remote sensing data in a simple crop model and evaluate the performance of this approach in quantifying crop production and the main components of the annual carbon budget for winter wheat. The SAFY-CO2 model simulates daily crop development (biomass, partition to leaves, etc.), the components of net ecosystem CO2 fluxes, and the annual yield and net ecosystem carbon budget (NECB). Multi-temporal green area index (GAI) maps derived from HSTR data from the Formosat-2 and SPOT satellites were used to calibrate the light-use efficiency and phenological parameters of the model. Data from the literature were used to set a priori values for a set of model parameters, and a large dataset of in situ data was used for model validation. This dataset includes 8 years of eddy-covariance net CO2 flux measurements and GAL biomass and yield data acquired at 2 instrumented sites in southwest France. Biomass and yield data from 16 fields in the study area between 2005 and 2014 were also used for validation. The SAFY-CO2 model is able to reproduce both GAI dynamics (RRMSE = 14%, R-2 = 0.97) and biomass production and yield (RRMSE of 27% and 21%, respectively) with high precisions under contrasting climatic, environmental and management conditions. Additionally, the net CO2 flux components estimated by the model generally agreed well with in situ data and presented very good and significant correlations (RMSE of 1.74, 1.13 and 1.29 gC.m(-2).d for GPP, R-eco and NEE, respectively; R-2 of 0.90, 0.75 and 0.85 for GPP, R-eco and NEE, respectively) over the 8 studied years. This study also highlights the importance of accounting for post-harvest vegetative events (spontaneous re-growth, weed development and cover crops) for an accurate calculation of the annual net CO2 flux. This approach requires a limited number of input parameters for estimating yield and net CO2 flux components, which is promising for regional/global-scale applications based on Sentinel 2-like data; however, the approach requires plot-scale data concerning organic amendments and straw management (exportation) in animal farming systems to calculate field C budgets.","[Pique, Gaetan; Fieuzal, Remy; Al Bitar, Ahmad; Veloso, Amanda; Tallec, Tiphaine; Brut, Aurore; Ferlicoq, Morgan; Zawilski, Bartosz; Dejoux, Jean-Francois; Gibrin, Herve] Univ Toulouse, CESBIO, CNES CNRS INRA IRD UPS, Toulouse, France; [Pique, Gaetan] Agence Environm & Maitrise Energie ADEME, Angers 1, France; [Ceschia, Eric] INRA, USC CESBIO 1439, Toulouse, France",,"Pique, G (corresponding author), Univ Toulouse, CESBIO, CNES CNRS INRA IRD UPS, Toulouse, France.",piqueg@cesbio.cnes.fr,"Farmaha, Bhupinder/ABH-1387-2020; ceschia, eric E/P-5054-2014","ceschia, eric E/0000-0001-5941-752X; Zawilski, Bartosz Marian/0000-0001-9155-1331",Agence De l'Environnement et de la Maitrise de l'Energie (ADEME); Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales (CNES); Agence de l'Eau Adour Garonne (AEAG); European Union [730074]; Institut National des Sciences de l'Univers of the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS-INSU) through the ICOS observatory; Institut National des Sciences de l'Univers of the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS-INSU) through the OSR SW observatory; University Toulouse III - Paul Sabatier; CNES; Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD),Agence De l'Environnement et de la Maitrise de l'Energie (ADEME); Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales (CNES)(Centre National D'etudes Spatiales); Agence de l'Eau Adour Garonne (AEAG); European Union(European Commission); Institut National des Sciences de l'Univers of the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS-INSU) through the ICOS observatory; Institut National des Sciences de l'Univers of the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS-INSU) through the OSR SW observatory; University Toulouse III - Paul Sabatier; CNES(Centre National D'etudes Spatiales); Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD),"This work was made possible through the support of the Agence De l'Environnement et de la Maitrise de l'Energie (ADEME), which financed the project Couverts Intermediaires pour l'attenuation du Changement Climatique (CICC) and half of Gaetan's and Morgan's PhDs, the Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales (CNES), which financed half of Gaetan's PhD, and the Agence de l'Eau Adour Garonne (AEAG), which financed the Bag'ages project and the support of the European Union that financed the Sensagri project (Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme, Grant Agreement n degrees 730074).; Data acquisition at FR-Lam and FR-Aur were mainly funded by the Institut National des Sciences de l'Univers of the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS-INSU) through the ICOS and OSR SW observatories.

The present study aimed at estimating area under poplar plantations and assessment of biomass production and carbon stock at district level for selected districts of Punjab and Haryana states. High resolution multispectral remote sensing data (LISS-IV, spatial resolution- 5.8 m) have been used for mapping poplar area in these districts. Growth data (tree density, diameter at breast height) from farmers' fields were collected for assessment of aboveground and total biomass.

In this study we used a sample set included in the Finnish national soil monitoring network (n = 125) to determine the SOC stock and its vertical distribution in Finnish agricultural mineral soils using fixed depth (FD) and equivalent soil mass (ESM) methods. Further, we explored the within-field variation in SOC stock and minimum sample size in the context of SOC sequestration. Boreal agricultural mineral soils were found to be rich in SOC. The average SOC stock ranged between 8.4 and 9.8 kg m(-2)in the top 30 cm depending on cropping system and soil type. Cultivation of perennial crops tended to enrich the C close to the soil surface in comparison to dominantly annual crops, which exhibited a less steep C gradient with depth. The commonly used van Bemmelen factor of 1.724 to convert results of loss on ignition to SOC was found to be appropriate for coarse-textured Finnish agricultural soils. However, the results showed that in clay-rich soils, it is critical to take into account the structural water bound in clay particles to avoid overestimation of the SOC content. The study also demonstrated that the minimum sample size required to detect the change of 0.1 kg C m(-2)at field level is typically several hundreds. Therefore empirical soil sampling is not at all cost-effective enough for verifying the changes in SOC stocks with regard to compensation of C sequestration for farmers. Thus, alternative verification methods, such as SOC modelling in combination with field-level data collected, for example, using remote sensing should be developed further.

Agriculture being a predominant global land use, C sequestration under different agro-ecosystems through appropriate management practices is an important option to combat the anthropogenic climate change. Conservation tillage along with residue management, stubble retention, mulching, organic farming and integrated nutrient management not only facilitates soil C storage but also improves soil health. Change in land-uses and cropping system also impart notable effects on soil C turnover. Biochar application is found effective in augmenting soil C stock and improving soil aggregation. Bioenergy plantations are also effective in sequestering C. Simulation models and remote sensing are innovative tools for predicting and mapping soil C status and identifying site-specific strategic policies to minimize the risk of land degradation and to maintain environmental sustainability. Therefore, the aim of this review is to disseminate ideas regarding current C status, identify researchable priorities and to deliberate pros and cons of agricultural management practices for better implementation of soil C sequestration strategies for mitigating the consequences of climate change.","[Mandal, Agniva; Mani, Pabitra Kumar] Bidhan Chandra Krishi Viswavidyalaya, Dept Agr Chem & Soil Sci, Mohanpur, India; [Mandal, Agniva; Mani, Pabitra Kumar] Bidhan Chandra Agr Univ BCKV Campus, Bhabha Atom Res Ctr RNARC BARC, Reg Nucl Agr Res Ctr, Mohanpur, W Bengal, India; [Majumder, Atin] Indian Inst Remote Sensing IIRS ISRO, Agr & Soil Dept, Dehra Dun, Uttarakhand, India; [Dhaliwal, S.

Rangelands cover 54% of California, representing a large stock of SOC, but existing SOC estimates are uncertain. To improve understanding of fine-resolution SOC stocks in complex terrain and provide guidance to rangeland SOC inventories, we grid-sampled 105 locations (21-m grid cells) at two depths (0-10 and 10-30 cm) in a 10-ha annual grassland catchment in California's Central Coast Range. Soils were analyzed for bulk density, coarse fragments, SOC and texture. Monthly aerial imagery was acquired by an unmanned aerial vehicle to compare surface reflectance during two contrasting years (wet vs. dry) to SOC stocks. We found that the 0-30 cm soil thickness held 3.64 +/- 0.71 kg SOC m(-2) (mean +/- SD) with a range of 1.97-5.49 kg SOC m(-2). The 0-10 cm soil thickness stored 47% of the 0-30 cm SOC stock with SOC concentrations twice as high in the 0-10 cm layer (1.40 +/- 0.38%) as in the 10-30 cm layer (0.71 +/- 0.15% SOC). Multiple linear regression (MLR) models explained 50-57% of SOC variability at 0-30 and 10-30 cm, but only 25% of variability at 0-10 cm. Based on cross-validation tests, MLR outperformed spatial interpolation methods and Random Forest models, best explaining SOC stocks with five environmental covariates: wet-year greenness, mean curvature, elevation, insolation, and slope. Lower hillslope positions, concave landforms, and enhanced wet-year greenness were associated with more SOC, and explained 11%, 24%, and 31% of variability in 0-30 cm SOC stocks, respectively. This study demonstrates that the accuracy of regional-scale SOC mapping of California rangelands benefits from considering microclimatic and topographic controls at the catchment-scale, in addition to broader scale mineralogical and macroclimatic controls identified in previous SOC studies.","[Devine, Scott M.; O'Geen, Anthony T.; Liu, Han; Jin, Yufang; Dahlke, Helen E.; Dahlgren, Randy A.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Land Air & Water Resources, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Larsen, Royce E.] Univ Calif Cooperat Extens, San Luis Obispo, CA 90001 USA",,"Devine, SM (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Dept Land Air & Water Resources, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",smdevine@ucdavis.edu,"Devine, Scott/AAR-1265-2020","Devine, Scott/0000-0002-2306-8281",Russell L.

We also examined the potential to estimate N leaching employing N-sensitive spectral reflectance indices. During three growing seasons 2013-2015, field experiment at two experimental sites combining application of distinct N doses (0 (N-0), 35 (N-35), 70 (N-70), and 140 (N-140) kg N ha(-1)) and two stable forms of organic C (lignohumate and compost) was established to measure N uptake by winter wheat and its leaching to subsoil layers. The spectral reflectance al canopy level was measured simultaneously with N content in leaf dry matter at the beginning of the grain filling phase. At full maturity, the above-ground biomass, grain yield, and grain protein content were evaluated. That data was used to calculate N uptake in grain. The N-140 dose led to increased N uptake by grain of 64% and 73% in the wetter years 2013 and 2014, respectively, and even by 118% in the drier year 2015 in comparison with the N-0 treatment. N leaching to subsoil increased substantially with higher N close, but only in wetter years 2013 (by 74%) and 2014 (by 87%). By contrast, no effect of N dose on leached N was found in the dry year 2015. The application of organic C along with the N-140 dose substantially reduced N leaching by 26% and 29% in 2014 and 2015, respectively. Moreover, we demonstrated that normalized red-edge spectral reflectance index (NRERI) is able to predict N uptake by wheat and it can serve as an indicator of N leaching in heavy-rainfall years. Our results thus point towards possible agronomic practices and use of remote-sensing techniques to reduce groundwater contamination by N-based fertilizers. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

A visible and near infrared (VisNIR) integrated multi-sensing penetrometer system was developed to automatically measure in situ soil VisNIR reflectance spectra, penetration resistance, and insertion depth along a soil profile. The system was tested in 11 agricultural fields in Nebraska, Illinois, Iowa, and South Dakota of the U.S. An independent soil VisNIR spectral library was used to build calibration models for soil property prediction. External Parameter Orthogonalization (EPO) was used to correct for the field intactness of in situ VisNIR spectra. The results showed that EPO was effective in correcting for the spectral disparity between in situ and dry-ground VisNIR spectra. The EPO correction showed an improvement of prediction accuracy of soil total carbon (R-2 and RMSE improved from 0.29 and 3.06 % to 0.5 and 0.79%, respectively) and total nitrogen (R-2 and RMSE improved from 0.51 and 0.36 % to 0.62 and 0.06 %, respectively). The system also predicted soil bulk density with an RMSE of 0.12 g cm(-3) and R-2 of 0.80. It is concluded that the VisNIR multi-sensing penetrometer, along with the use of external soil spectral libraries and the spectral correction algorithm EPO, can lead to a rapid, robust and cost-effective system for in situ high resolution vertical soil sensing.","[Wijewardane, Nuwan K.; Ge, Yufeng] Univ Nebraska, Dept Biol Syst Engn, 203 LW Chase Hall,East Campus, Lincoln, NE 68583 USA; [Hetrick, Sarah] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Soil & Crop Sci, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Ackerson, Jason] Purdue Univ, Dept Agron, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Morgan, Cristine L.

This study aimed to explore the potential of airborne hyperspectral image to estimate the SOC of bare topsoil at an agricultural site located in the southeast part of Iowa State, United States. To magnify the subtle spectral signals concerning SOC, and accelerate calibration and improve predictive ability, we developed a framework to combine two advanced spectral algorithms, namely, fractional-order derivative (FOD) and optimal band combination algorithm for SOC predicting. Our case was based on 49 soil samples and a scattered airborne hyperspectral image. Random forest (RF) was utilized to establish SOC estimation models by incorporating the optimal spectral indices processed by different FOD transformations on the basis of the optimal band combination algorithm. Results indicated that when the fractional order increased, overlapping peaks and baseline drifts were gradually removed. However, the magnitude of spectral strength decreased concurrently. More detailed and abundant spectral variability was captured by FOD as compared with those by original reflectance and first and second derivatives. The estimation accuracies developed from the optimal band combination algorithm (cross validation R-2, 0.36-0.66) were generally better than those from full-spectrum data (cross-validation R-2, 0.32-0.54). The RF model based on the combination of 0.75-order reflectance and optimal band combination algorithm obtained the highest estimation accuracy for SOC with cross-validation R-2 of 0.66. This research provides guidance for future studies in selecting the most appropriate FOD transformation to preprocess spectral data and in using the optimal band combination algorithm to determine the spectral index. Airborne hyperspectral image-based modeling can be further used to map agricultural topsoil SOC to support local-scale agricultural planning.","[Hong, Yongsheng; Chen, Yiyun; Liu, Yaolin; Liu, Yanfang; Cheng, Hang; Liu, Yi] Wuhan Univ, Sch Resource & Environm Sci, Wuhan 430079, Peoples R China; [Hong, Yongsheng; Mouazen, Abdul M.] Univ Ghent, Dept Environm, Coupure Links 653, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Guo, Long] Huazhong Agr Univ, Coll Resources & Environm, Wuhan 430070, Peoples R China; [Chen, Songchao] INRA, Unite InfoSol, F-45075 Orleans, France; [Chen, Songchao] INRA, UMR SAS, Agrocampus, F-35042 Rennes, France; [Linderman, Marc] Univ Iowa, Geog & Sustainabil Sci, Iowa City, IA 52246 USA; [Yu, Lei] Cent China Normal Univ, Sch Urban & Environm Sci, Wuhan 430079, Peoples R China; [Yu, Lei] Cent China Normal Univ, Key Lab Geog Proc Anal & Simulat Hubei Prov, Wuhan 430079, Peoples R China; [Chen, Yiyun] Chinese Acad Sci, State Key Lab Soil & Sustainable Agr, Nanjing 210008, Peoples R China",,"Chen, YY; Liu, YL (corresponding author), Wuhan Univ, Sch Resource & Environm Sci, Wuhan 430079, Peoples R China.",chenyy@whu.edu.cn; yaolin6100@sina.com,", chh/AAM-1160-2020; Chen, Songchao/S-7982-2019; Mouazen, Abdul M./AAO-9709-2020","Chen, Songchao/0000-0003-1245-0482; Mouazen, Abdul M./0000-0002-0354-0067",National Natural Science Foundation of China [41771440]; China Scholarship Council [201906270092]; Research Foundation - Flanders (FWO) [G0F9216N],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); China Scholarship Council(China Scholarship Council); Research Foundation - Flanders (FWO)(FWO),"This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant numbers: 41771440).

An integrated field and laboratory approach was undertaken, through measurements of reflectance spectra of soil using an Analytical Spectral Device (ASD) FieldSpec (R) 4 optical sensor. Soil spectra were collected on the land surface under field conditions and then on soil in the laboratory, in order to assess the accuracy of field spectroscopy-based models. The predictive performance of two different statistical models (random forest and partial least square regression) was compared. Results show that random forest regression can most accurately predict the soil organic carbon contents on an independent dataset using the field spectroscopy data. In contrast, the partial least square regression model overfits the calibration dataset. Important wavelengths to predict soil organic contents were localised around the visible range (400-700 nm).

These attributes are relevant for the preservation and proper management of land use in the pursuit of a sustainable agriculture. Laboratory and satellite sensors have been applied as a powerful tool for studying so is, but their analysis using these sensors has mainly focused on the visible (Vis), near infrared (NIR) and shortwave infrared (SWIR) regions of the electro-magnetic spectrum, with few studies in the Medium Infrared (MIR). The aim of this study was to identify the spectral pattern of soils with different granulometry (sand and clay) and OC content using laboratory and satellite sensors in the MIR region, specifically in the Thermal Infrared (TIR) range (ASTER, Landsat satellites). The study performed qualitative and quantitative analyses of clay, OC and sand fractions (fine and coarse). The study area is located in the region of Piracicaba, Sao Paulo, Brazil, where collected 150 soil samples (0-20 cm depth). Soil texture was determined by the pipette method and OC via dry combustion. Reflectance and emissivity (epsilon) spectral data were obtained with the Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) Alpha sensor (Bruker Optics Corporation). An image ASTER 05 from July 15, 2017 was acquired with values of epsilon. Samples were separated by textural classes and the spectral behavior in the TIR region was described. The data obtained by the laboratory sensor were resampled to the satellite sensor bands. The behavior between spectra of both sensors was similar and had significant correlation with the studied attributes, mainly sand. For the partial least squares regression (PLSR) models, six strategies were used (MIR, MIR_ASTER, ASTER, TIR, TIR Correlation Index (TIR_CID), and MIR Correlation Index (MIR_CID)), which consisted in the use of all sensors bands, or by the selection of bands that presented the most significant correlations with each one of the attributes. Models presented a good performance in the prediction of all attributes using the whole MIR. In the TIR region, the models for total sand content and for fine and coarse fractions were good. Models created with ASTER sensor data were not as promising as those with laboratory ones. The use of specific bands was useful in estimating some attributes in the MIR and TIR, improving the predictive performance and validation of models. Therefore, the discrimination of soil attributes with satellite sensors can be improved with the identification of specific bands, as observed in the results with laboratory sensors.","[Salazar, Diego F.

The objective of this work was to check the predictive capability of SOC and soil pH over different ecoregions. First, we collected a series of satellite images from 2017 and ancillary variables (e.g., climate and terrain) as spectral and environmental indicators, respectively. A total of 201 topsoil samples (0-20 cm) from the Northeastern Black Soil Region of China were also used. Then, the relationships between the two soil properties and indicators were analyzed. The indicators that showed significant correlation with SOC or soil pH were involved in the subsequent models. Finally, the SOC and soil pH prediction models were constructed by using a stepwise regression model. The results showed that the visible and shortwave infrared bands, along with the thermal infrared band, had strong correlations with the two soil properties. Environmental factors such as precipitation, temperature, and elevation all had an impact on the distribution of SOC and soil pH. The SOC and soil pH prediction models had R-2 values of 0.66 and 0.73, root mean square errors of 0.21 and 0.58, and residual prediction deviations of 1.46 and 1.53, respectively, indicating reliable precision and average prediction abilities. This approach to estimating SOC and soil pH can contribute to improving our understanding and the modeling of soil processes at a large scale and in areas with relatively complex landscapes.","[Zhang, Yue; Shen, Haiou; Gao, Qiang; Zhao, Lanpo] Jilin Agr Univ, Coll Resources & Environm, 2888 Xincheng Rd, Changchun 130118, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Yue; Shen, Haiou; Gao, Qiang; Zhao, Lanpo] Jilin Agr Univ, Key Lab Soil Resource Sustainable Utilizat Jilin, 2888 Xincheng Rd, Changchun 130118, Peoples R China",,"Gao, Q (corresponding author), Jilin Agr Univ, Coll Resources & Environm, 2888 Xincheng Rd, Changchun 130118, Peoples R China.",gyt9962@126.com,,,National Key R&D Program of China [2016YFE0202900]; Education Department of Jilin Province [JJKH20190915KJ],National Key R&D Program of China; Education Department of Jilin Province,"National Key R&D Program of China, Grant/Award Number: (2016YFE0202900); Education Department of Jilin Province, Grant/Award Number: (JJKH20190915KJ)",,57,7,7,3,28,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0361-5995,1435-0661,,SOIL SCI SOC AM J,Soil Sci.

This study bridges the knowledge gap regarding payment for ecosystem services through carbon sequestration by poplar farmers. This study was conducted in year 2018 with the objective of estimating the quantity and value of carbon sequestered by poplar based agroforestry systems. Remote sensing analysis for year 2017 revealed that poplar is dominant tree species grown by farmers on their field and occupied about 13.97% of district's geographical area. Timber production of poplar trees was estimated at 45.9 and 113.3 t/ha for seven years of rotation in boundary and agrisilviculture systems, respectively. The CO2 sequestered by poplar trees in boundary and agrisilviculture systems come out to be 99.2 and 242.0 tCO(2) e for seven year-old plantation, and total value of this carbon sequestered was estimated at US$ 1778 and 4673 @US$ 5.1/t CO(2)e for seven years of rotation, respectively. At district level, estimated value for carbon sequestered by poplar based agroforestry systems was amounted to US$ 25.43 million @US$ 5.1/t CO2 e for entire rotation period of seven years in an area of 172506.96 ha. At country level, this ecosystem service of carbon sequestration would yield hefty amount of about US$ 285 million ((sic) 185 billion). Hence, poplar based agroforestry systems in India are sustainable solution for not only climate change mitigation but can also enhance farmers' income through payment of ecosystems service.","[Rizvi, R.

When using environmental covariates to map SOC content or stock, variables indicating human activities have drawn growing attentions. Crop species/crop rotations and agricultural management significantly affect the spatial variation of SOC in croplands. For areas where climatic conditions and farming managements are generally consistent in cultivation territory of one crop species, crop phenology largely indicates the crop response to soil. Therefore, phenological parameters incorporating with crop rotation could be effective for mapping soil organic carbon in these areas. In this study, we extracted phenological parameters from Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series data, and used these variables with crop rotation for predicting topsoil organic carbon content in a cropland area in Anhui province, China. Forty-nine sampling points were collected in field. For these points, there were three crop rotations each with two crop species per year. Twenty-two HJ-1 A/B images for 2010 year with a 30 m resolution were obtained. Eleven phenological parameters for each of the two growing seasons were obtained with a dynamic threshold method. Various combinations of predictive variables were developed based on variable importance and experimented for predicting topsoil organic carbon using random forest. The prediction results were validated using a cross validation approach. Results showed that base levels (given as the average of the left and right minimum values of a time series profile) for both seasons were the most important predictors in this area. Adding both crop rotation and the two phenological parameters to the natural environment variables increased the prediction accuracies by 50% in terms of R-2 and 13.4% in terms of root mean square error (RMSE). This study demonstrates the effectiveness of crop phenology in mapping SOC in croplands.","[Yang, Lin; He, Xianglin; Shen, Feixue; Zhou, Chenghu; Li, Manchun] Nanjing Univ, Sch Geog & Ocean Sci, Nanjing 210023, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Yang, Lin; Zhou, Chenghu; Zhu, A-Xing] Chinese Acad Sci, State Key Lab Resources & Environm Informat Syst, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Zhu, A-Xing] Nanjing Normal Univ, Key Lab Virtual Geog Environm, Minist Educ, Nanjing 210023, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Gao, Bingbo] China Agr Univ, Coll Land Sci & Technol, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Chen, Ziyue] Beijing Normal Univ, Coll Global Change & Earth Syst Sci, State Key Lab Remote Sensing Sci, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China",,"Li, MC (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ, Sch Geog & Ocean Sci, Nanjing 210023, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.;Chen, ZY (corresponding author), Beijing Normal Univ, Coll Global Change & Earth Syst Sci, State Key Lab Remote Sensing Sci, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.",zychen@bnu.edu.cn; limanchun@nju.edu.cn,"Yang, Lin/ABG-5551-2021","Shen, feixue/0000-0002-8039-6062; Yang, Lin/0000-0002-7576-4481","National Natural Science Foundation of China [41971054, 41471178, 41530749]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [020914380049, 020914380056]; Leading Funds for the First class Universities [020914912203, 020914902302]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); Leading Funds for the First class Universities,"This study is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Project No. 41971054; 41471178; 41530749), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (020914380049 and 020914380056), and the Leading Funds for the First class Universities (020914912203 and 020914902302).",,105,25,26,12,81,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0167-1987,1879-3444,,SOIL TILL RES,Soil Tillage Res.,FEB,2020,196,,,,,,,104465,10.1016/j.still.2019.104465,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.still.2019.104465,,13,Soil Science,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,JU1CV,,,,,2022-08-23

The Nile delta provides two thirds of Egypt's agriculture land, but is threatened by urban sprawl. The paper aims to quantify urban expansion over a 45 year period using 6 time points from 1972 to 2017, and its impacts on agricultural potential, soil organic carbon stocks, and implications for water use. The study used multi-temporal satellite data and remote sensing techniques (Maximum Likelihood supervised classification, and NDVI), soil sampling and analysis, data on water irrigation, and agroecological system and ecosystem services model (MicroLEIS, InVEST) to assess the effects of land use change. Urban area increased by a factor of 5, from 452 km2 in 1972 to 2644 km2 in 2017. The greatest losses occurred to the fertile Vertic Torrifluvent soils on the older delta, which lost 1734 km2. Soil organic carbon (0-75 cm depth) lost as a result of soil sealing from urbanisation rose from 25,000 to 141,000 Mg C over the 45 years. As a result of increased pressure on delta land, agriculture expanded into the higher desert areas outside the delta, on marginal land sustained by intensive fertiliser use and irrigation, which in turn puts pressure on water use. Therefore, rapid urban expansion has resulted in a loss of soil carbon and a shift in agriculture from fertile soils to marginal soils, requiring more capital inputs, which is ultimately less sustainable. Modelling suggested that soil management improvement could make better use of fertile soils within the Delta currently affected by high salinity and poor drainage. Future planning should encourage urban expansion on the less fertile soils outside of the delta, while improving suitability of existing agricultural land and minimising land degradation within the delta.","[Abd-Elmabod, Sameh K.; Zhang, Zhenhua] Jiangsu Acad Agr Sci, Inst Agr Resources & Environm, Nanjing 210014, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Abd-Elmabod, Sameh K.; Ali, Ramadan R.] Natl Res Ctr, Soils & Water Use Dept, Cairo 12622, Egypt; [Abd-Elmabod, Sameh K.; Fitch, Alice C.; Jones, Laurence] Ctr Ecol & Hydrol CEH Bangor, Environm Ctr Wales, Deiniol Rd, Bangor LL57 2UW, Gwynedd, Wales",,"Abd-Elmabod, SK (corresponding author), Natl Res Ctr, Soils & Water Use Dept, Agr & Biol Res Div, Cairo, Egypt.",sameh_kotb777@yahoo.com,"Jones, Laurence/A-3900-2011; Ali, Rafat/A-7551-2016","Jones, Laurence/0000-0002-4379-9006; Ali, Rafat/0000-0002-2483-2907; ABD-ELMABOD, SAMEH KOTB/0000-0003-1697-7564; Fitch, Alice/0000-0002-6260-8957","British Council (Newton Fund, UK); Science and Technology Development Fund (STDF, Egypt) [27663]; Talented Young Scientist Program (TYSP), China Science and Technology Exchange Center","British Council (Newton Fund, UK); Science and Technology Development Fund (STDF, Egypt)(Science and Technology Development Fund (STDF)); Talented Young Scientist Program (TYSP), China Science and Technology Exchange Center","We thank the British Council (Newton Fund, UK) and Science and Technology Development Fund (STDF, Egypt) for funding this project (ID 27663).

More work is still needed to develop algorithms for GPP estimation applicable to multiple, if not all, vegetation types, phenological phases, and environmental conditions. This study employed neural networks (NN), multiple linear regressions (MLR), and vegetation indices (VI) to develop algorithms for GPP estimation based solely on remotely sensed data in two crops, maize (Zea mays L.) and soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.], with contrasting canopy architectures, leaf structures, and photosynthetic pathways. The focus of the study was to devise algorithms not requiring re-parameterization for different crop species. Data used in the models included in situ hyperspectral reflectance and satellite surface reflectance products. For the tested NN, MLR, and VI algorithms, the bands selected to obtain minimal errors in maize and soybean combined were mainly located in red edge and near infrared (NIR) spectral regions. For both in situ reflectance and satellite surface reflectance, a NN estimated GPP with normalized root mean square errors (NRMSE) below 14 and 18.7%, respectively, and VI using bands in red edge and NIR with NRMSE 15.6 and 20.4%, respectively. The results showed that the models based on the red edge and NIR bands may facilitate accurate assessments of crop GPP at multiple scales, from close range to satellite platforms.","[Peng, Yi] Wuhan Univ, Sch Remote Sensing & Informat Engn, Wuhan 430079, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Peng, Yi] Wuhan Univ, Lab Remote Sensing Crop Phenotyping, Wuhan 430079, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Kira, Oz; Sun, Ying] Cornell Univ, Soil & Crop Sci, Sch Integrat Plant Sci, Coll Agr & Life Sci, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Nguy-Robertson, Anthony; Suyker, Andrew; Gitelson, Anatoly A.] Univ Nebraska, Sch Nat Resources, Lincoln, NE 68583 USA; [Arkebauer, Timothy] Univ Nebraska, Dept Agron & Hort, Lincoln, NE 68583 USA; [Gitelson, Anatoly A.] Israel Inst Technol Technion, IL-3200003 Haifa, Israel",,"Kira, O (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, Soil & Crop Sci, Sch Integrat Plant Sci, Coll Agr & Life Sci, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.;Gitelson, AA (corresponding author), Univ Nebraska, Sch Nat Resources, Lincoln, NE 68583 USA.;Gitelson, AA (corresponding author), Israel Inst Technol Technion, IL-3200003 Haifa, Israel.",ok78@cornell.edu; agitelson2@unl.edu,"Suyker, Andy E./ABC-8910-2021; Kira, Oz/AAH-9526-2020","kira, oz/0000-0002-1620-2323; Sun, Ying/0000-0002-9819-1241","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab AmeriFlux Data Management Program; Carbon Sequestration Program, University of Nebraska-Lincoln Agricultural Research Division; U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Science; Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station; Hatch Act through the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture [1002649]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41771381]; BARD, the United States-Israel Binational Agricultural Research and Development Fund, Vaadia-BARD Postdoctoral Fellowship Award [FI-576-18]","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab AmeriFlux Data Management Program; Carbon Sequestration Program, University of Nebraska-Lincoln Agricultural Research Division; U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Science(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station; Hatch Act through the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); BARD, the United States-Israel Binational Agricultural Research and Development Fund, Vaadia-BARD Postdoctoral Fellowship Award","The US-Ne1, US-Ne2, and US-Ne3 AmeriFlux sites are supported by the Lawrence Berkeley National Lab AmeriFlux Data Management Program and by the Carbon Sequestration Program, University of Nebraska-Lincoln Agricultural Research Division.

This study aimed to predict the spatial distribution of soil fractions (i.e. percentages of sand, silt, and clay) in Sistan floodplain on a regional scale (area: 1500 km(2)). Random forest (RF), regression kriging-neural network residual kriging (RKNNRK), neural network residual kriging (NNRK), regression kriging (RK), and cokriging (COK) methods were used to map soil texture components over the region. Soil fractions were measured for 160 soil samples taken from the surface layer (0-30 cm) of various soil series in agriculture land of Sistan floodplain. The additive log-ratio (air) transformation was applied to transform texture components prior to prediction. Remote sensing data including Landsat 8' Bands (1-8), Band 4 to Band 8 ratio, Band 4 to Band 3 ratio, NDVI, GSI, Brightness Index, and Clay Index were used as auxiliary variables for interpolation of soil fractions. 80% of actual data was used for prediction and 20% of data was used for validation. The performance of methods used was evaluated using RMSE, ME and MAE criteria. The results showed that the RKNNRK model has the highest accuracy for prediction of sand (RMSE = 15.04%) and clay (RMSE = 8.77%) contents while the most accurate model for predicting silt content is NNRK (RMSE = 12.68%). RK and COK performed worse than NNRK and RKNNRK. A relatively high value of RMSE obtained for sand (17.89%), silt (14.15%), and clay (8.89%) contents by the RF model. This could be due to the low relief of study area, regional scale effects, low density of sampling points and high heterogeneity of soil texture components in floodplains. Our findings revealed that RKNNRK and NNRK models, when combined with remote sensing data, produce more accurate results and therefore can be used for appropriate mapping of soil fractions in floodplains and on a regional scale.","[Shahriari, Mohammad; Delbari, Masoomeh; Afrasiab, Peyman] Univ Zabol, Fac Water & Soil, Dept Water Engn, Zabol, Iran; [Pahlavan-Rad, Mohammad Reza] AREEO, Sistan Agr & Nat Resources Res & Educ Ctr, Soil & Water Res Departmem, Zabol, Iran; [Pahlavan-Rad, Mohammad Reza] AREEO, Golestan Agr & Nat Resources Res & Educ Ctr, Soil & Water Res Departmem, Gorgon, Iran",,"Delbari, M (corresponding author), Univ Zabol, Fac Water & Soil, Dept Water Engn, Zabol, Iran.",masoomeh.delbari@uoz.ac.ir,"Rad, Mohammad Reza Pahlavan/AAE-1843-2020","Rad, Mohammad Reza Pahlavan/0000-0001-7821-8585; Delbari, Masoomeh/0000-0002-9902-9633; Shahriari, Mohammadreza/0000-0002-7519-3172",,,,,79,15,16,4,67,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0341-8162,1872-6887,,CATENA,Catena,NOV,2019,182,,,,,,,104149,10.1016/j.catena.2019.104149,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2019.104149,,12,"Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Soil Science; Water Resources",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Geology; Agriculture; Water Resources,IS9UP,,,,,2022-08-23

Spectral remote sensing indices that rely on shortwave-infrared (SWIR) or near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths have been developed to quantify spatial patterns in SOC. However, the application of SWIR- and NIR-based indices for quantifying fine-scale patterns of SOC is limited due to the requirement of high-resolution multispectral or hyperspectral imagery. Visible wavelengths are measured by virtually all sensors, often at high resolution; hence, development of a visible wavelength-based index can greatly increase the ability to remotely estimate SOC. Here we develop such an index by assessing the relationship between laboratory-measured SOC and spectral reflectance using 7916 SOC and hyperspectral measurements from the nationwide USDA Rapid Carbon Assessment. Our new SOC index (SOCI) predicts SOC concentrations for the 7916 samples with a RMSE of 1.5%, which is comparable to predictions from the SWIR/NIR ratio (RMSE = 1.3%) and outperforms the predictions of an index based on NIR and red wavelengths (RMSE = 2.8%). We applied the index to a high-resolution satellite image and tested the ability of the image-based SOCI to predict measured SOC concentrations for a plowed field in Iowa. Regression models with and without local calibration data accurately predict measured SOC, with RMSE values of similar to 0.5%. Given the widespread availability of imagery with spectral data in the visible wavelengths, there is potential to use the SOCI to address a range of soil-agronomic problems.","[Thaler, Evan A.; Larsen, Isaac J.; Yu, Qian] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Geosci, 233 Morrill Sci Ctr, Amherst, MA 01003 USA",,"Thaler, EA (corresponding author), Univ Massachusetts, Dept Geosci, 233 Morrill Sci Ctr, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.",ethaler@geo.umass.edu,,"Yu, Qian/0000-0001-6816-3082",NASA [80NSSCK0747],NASA(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)),"The research was funded by NASA grant 80NSSCK0747 (to I.

However, it is not clear which is the optimal (e.g. coarsest possible) spatial resolution to capture those fluxes accurately. Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) can address this by collecting very high spatial resolution ( < 1 m, VHR) imagery. The objective of this study is to model ET and GPP dynamics using VHR optical and thermal imagery and quantify the influence of the spatial heterogeneity in the flux simulations and validations. The study was conducted at a deciduous willow bioenergy eddy covariance (EC) flux site in Denmark. Flight campaigns were conducted during the growing seasons of 2016 and 2017 with a hexacopter equipped with RGB, multispectral and thermal infrared cameras. A 'top-down' modeling approach consisting of the Priestley-Taylor Jet Propulsion Laboratory model and a light use efficiency model sharing the same canopy biophysical constraints was used to estimate ET and GPP. Model outputs were benchmarked by EC flux observations with the source weighted footprint. Our results indicate that our model can well estimate the instantaneous net radiation, ET, GPP, evaporative fraction, light use efficiency and water use efficiency with root-mean-square deviations (RMSD) of 31.6 W.m(-2), 41.2 W.m(-2), 3.12 mu mol.C.m(-2).s(-1), 0.08, 0.16 g.C.MJ(-1) and 0.35 g.C.kg(-1), respectively. Further, it is found that using a footprint model to sample different areas of VHR imagery can be a tool to provide better diurnal estimates to benchmark with EC data. Moreover, these VHR maps (0.3 m) allowed us to quantify metrics of spatial heterogeneity by using semivariogram analysis and by aggregating model inputs into different spatial resolutions. For instance, we find that in this site, the aggregation of simulated GPP using the source weighted mean of the EC footprint was about 30% lower in RMSD than using the arithmetic mean of the footprint. This demonstrates the accuracy of the modeled VHR spatial patterns. Nevertheless, we also find that imagery resolution consistent with the canopy size (around 1.5 m in our study) is sufficient to capture the spatial heterogeneity of the fluxes as transpiration and canopy assimilation of CO2 are processes regulated at the tree crown level. Our results highlight the importance of considering the land surface heterogeneity for flux modeling and the source contribution within the EC footprint for model benchmarking at appropriate spatial resolutions.","[Wang, Sheng; Garcia, Monica; Bauer-Gottwein, Peter; Bandini, Filippo; Paz, Veronica Sobejano; Ibrom, Andreas] Tech Univ Denmark, Dept Environm Engn, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark; [Jakobsen, Jakob] Tech Univ Denmark, Natl Space Inst, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark; [Zarco-Tejada, Pablo J.] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Sch Engn, Dept Infrastruct Engn, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Zarco-Tejada, Pablo J.] Univ Melbourne, Fac Vet & Agr Sci, Sch Agr & Food, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Zarco-Tejada, Pablo J.] CSIC, IAS, Cordoba, Spain; [Garcia, Monica] Columbia Univ, Earth Inst, Int Res Inst Climate & Soc, Palisades, NY USA",,"Wang, S; Garcia, M (corresponding author), Tech Univ Denmark, Dept Environm Engn, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark.;Garcia, M (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, Earth Inst, Int Res Inst Climate & Soc, Palisades, NY USA.",shengwang12@gmail.com; mgarc@env.dtu.dk,"Zarco-Tejada, Pablo J./AAZ-3704-2020; bandini, filippo/W-2046-2019; Wang, Sheng/S-4733-2019; Garcia, Monica/N-1206-2014; Zarco-Tejada, Pablo J./A-6874-2012; Bauer-Gottwein, Peter/G-8725-2011","bandini, filippo/0000-0002-8470-2493; Wang, Sheng/0000-0003-3385-3109; Garcia, Monica/0000-0002-4587-8920; Zarco-Tejada, Pablo J./0000-0003-1433-6165; Bauer-Gottwein, Peter/0000-0002-9861-4240; Sobejano Paz, Veronica/0000-0002-0493-798X; Garcia, Monica/0000-0002-3814-2536",European Union (EU); Innovation Fund Denmark (IFD); Smart UAV project [125-2013-5]; Department of Environmental Engineering at DTU,European Union (EU)(CGIAREuropean Commission); Innovation Fund Denmark (IFD); Smart UAV project; Department of Environmental Engineering at DTU,"The authors would like to thank the European Union (EU) and Innovation Fund Denmark (IFD) for funding, in the frame of the collaborative international consortium AgWIT financed under the ERA NET Co-fund Water Works 2015 Call.

Peatland restoration aims at mitigating that situation by supporting CO2 uptake in these areas through raising the water table, in this way creating conditions for vegetation development and organic matter accumulation. We analysed the relationships between recovering vegetation and CO2 fluxes on three abandoned peat excavation sites in northern Estonia, which were rewetted and restored using the moss-layer-transfer technique three to ten years before the first measurements. Using chamber measurements, we determined whether these sites were CO2 sinks or sources during two growing seasons in 2015 (drier) and 2016 (wetter). In the drier growing season, all sites were CO2 sources from the peatland to the atmosphere (emissions from 1 to 77 g CO2 m(-2)), while in the wetter growing season, two sites were CO2 sinks (uptake from 13 to 210 g CO2 m(-2)). CO2 uptake was higher with higher plant and Eriophorum vaginatum cover, and biomass and cover of Sphagnum. The remotely sensed Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) explained about 25% of variation in Net Ecosystem Exchange; CO2 uptake was higher in plots with higher NDVI values. This provides a potential avenue of investigation of developing remote sensing methods in assessing spatial pattern of CO2 fluxes in restored peatlands. In order to increase CO2 uptake in abandoned milled peatlands, it is essential to raise the water level and thus reduce peat oxidation and create conditions for the development of vegetation similar to pristine peatlands.","[Purre, Anna-Helena; Pajula, Raimo; Ilomets, Mati] Tallinn Univ, Inst Ecol, Uus Sadama 5, EE-10120 Tallinn, Estonia",,"Purre, AH (corresponding author), Tallinn Univ, Inst Ecol, Uus Sadama 5, EE-10120 Tallinn, Estonia.",annahele@tlu.ee; Raimo.pajula@tlu.ee; ilomets@tlu.ee,"Purre, Anna-Helena/AAW-4601-2021",,Tallinn University Centre of Excellence of Natural Sciences and Sustainable Development; Estonian Geographical Society; Estonian Environmental Investment Centre [09-09-1/558]; Life + Climate mitigation Project Reduction of CO2 emissions by restoring degraded peatlands in Northern European Lowland [LIFE15 CCM/DE/000138],Tallinn University Centre of Excellence of Natural Sciences and Sustainable Development; Estonian Geographical Society; Estonian Environmental Investment Centre(Estonian Research Council); Life + Climate mitigation Project Reduction of CO2 emissions by restoring degraded peatlands in Northern European Lowland,"This research was supported by Tallinn University Centre of Excellence of Natural Sciences and Sustainable Development, scholarship of prof.

Soil samples were collected from 40 representative sites during November/December 2016 and analyzed for pH, electric conductivity (EC), organic carbon (OC), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), Ca, K, Na, and Mg. Landsat images were processed to produce spectral indices of water (MNDWI), vegetation (NDVI), salinity (NDSI), and urban areas (NDBI). Inverse distance weighting in ArcGIS 10.1 was used for mapping soil characteristics. Results refereed to a fluctuation in soil characteristics among different districts, as a result of variation and severity of activities. High levels of OC (3.5-5.21%) were recorded in several scattered parts while northern parts showed high levels of TP and TN recording 0.8-1.7mg/g and 1.7-2.4mg/g respectively. A great fluctuation in salinity, Ca, K, and Na levels were detected among the collected soil samples. Southern and eastern borders of the governorate showed high levels of Ca (>17.7mg/g). The most alkaline soil samples (>8) were mostly recorded in El-Fayoum and Tamia districts. Variation of soil characteristics is greatly impacted by irrigation using wastewater particularly from El-Bats and El-Wadi drains. A strong positive correlation (0.94) was observed between urbanization (NDBI) and land salinization (NDSI) which ensures the negative impact of residential areas on agricultural lands. It can be concluded that the agricultural land problems have greatly been impacted by the lack of sufficient water supply. Geospatial techniques along with soil analyses facilitate studying such problems.","[El-Zeiny, Ahmed M.; Effat, Hala A.] Natl Author Remote Sensing & Space Sci NARSS, Environm Studies & Land Use Div, POB 1564,23 Joseph Tito St, Cairo, Egypt",,"El-Zeiny, AM (corresponding author), Natl Author Remote Sensing & Space Sci NARSS, Environm Studies & Land Use Div, POB 1564,23 Joseph Tito St, Cairo, Egypt.",narss.ahmed@gmail.com; haeffat@yahoo.com,,"El-Zeiny, Ahmed/0000-0001-7246-2982",National Authority for Remote Sensing and Space Sciences [0511/SR/URB/2016]; United States Geological Survey,National Authority for Remote Sensing and Space Sciences; United States Geological Survey(United States Geological Survey),Authors acknowledge the National Authority for Remote Sensing and Space Sciences (Project code: 0511/SR/URB/2016) for sponsoring R & D project titled Regional Assessment of Environmental Vulnerability and Potentiality in El-Fayoum Governorate using Remote Sensing and GIS (Fiscal years 2016-2018) through which the paper data was acquired and The United States Geological Survey for supporting multi spectral Landsat imagery to this research.,,31,16,16,2,9,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0167-6369,1573-2959,,ENVIRON MONIT ASSESS,Environ.

Accuratelymapping SOMat regional scales is of critical importance for sustainable agriculture and soil utilization management and remains a grand challenge. Many studies used soil sampling data and machine learning algorithms to predict SOM at regional scales for a given year, while few studies mapped SOM formultiple years and examined its temporal dynamics. We compared the performance of fourmachine learning algorithms: decision tree (DT), bagging decision tree (BDT), randomforest (RF), and gradient boosting regression trees (GBRT) in mapping SOM in Hubei province, China over the 18-year period from 2000 to 2017. Our results showed that RF and DT had the highest coefficient of determination (R-2) (0.61) and the lowest potential bias (9.48 g/kg), respectively, while GBRT had the lowest mean error (ME) (1.26 g/kg), root mean squared error (RMSE) (5.41 g/kg) and Lin's concordance correlation coefficient (LCCC) (0.72). The SOM map based on GBRT better captured the distribution of the soil sample data than that based on RF. The trained GBRT model and the spatially explicitly data on explanatory variables (e.g., climate, terrain, remote sensing) were used to predict SOM for each 500 m x 500 m grid cell in Hubei for the period from 2000 to 2017. Our results showed that the SOM content of cropland was relatively high in the southeast and relatively low in the north. The SOM content in the topsoil varied from 0.89 to 58.86 g/kg and was averaged at 20.52 g/kg. The mean cropland SOM content of the province exhibited an increasing trend from 2000 to 2017 with an increase of 0.26 g/kg and a growth rate of 1.28%. Spatially, the SOMcontent increased in southernHubei and decreased in central and northern parts of the province. A large portion of the areas with decreasing SOM content in northern Hubei was reclaimed cropland, while a large part of the high-quality cropland with rising SOM content in the east (similar to 0.45 x 10(4) ha) was lost due to land use change (e.g., urbanization).

Hydrological and carbon processes in agricultural ecosystem models are complex due to interactions between parameters. It is therefore crucial to identify parameter sensitivity before a process-based model is applied for simulations and predictions of water, energy and carbon fluxes in agricultural ecosystems. In this study, we investigated the sensitivity and equifinality of the CoupModel parameters in modeling an arid agricultural ecosystem in northwestern China. In total, 27 model parameters were analyzed using a global parameters sensitivity analysis approach and a combination of multiple in situ and remotely sensed data sets. Among the five major model processes, we found that the energy balance process account for much of the importance in the model, followed by soil hydrology, plant growth, soil heat, and soil carbon processes. Meanwhile, parameters from the plant growth process exhibited higher equifinalities than other processes. We found that net ecosystem exchange (NEE) is controlled by soil heat, soil hydrology and energy balance processes, which is mainly due to a high equifinality (0.91) between the parameters g(max) (maximal stomatal conductance) and V-cmax (maximal carboxylation rate). The equifinalities between different parameters result in a trade-off in model performance metrics (i.e. determination coefficient R-2 and mean error ME) in the water, energy and carbon balance simulations. We revealed that daytime and yearly accumulated eddy fluxes (sensible heat H-s, latent heat LE and NEE) can constrain the model parameters better. Remotely sensed data were also promising as additional constraints on soil water contents and energy fluxes. This study introduced a systematic global parameter sensitivity analysis approach together with the equifinality identification in an ecosystem model. The approach proposed here is applicable to other studies and the equifinalities detected in this study can be important implications for modelling arid agricultural ecosystems. Additional exploration on remotely sensed data in constraining the model from different aspects are highly recommended in modeling agricultural ecosystems.","[Wu, Mousong] Nanjing Univ, Sch Geog & Ocean Sci, Int Inst Earth Syst Sci ESSI, Nanjing 210023, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Wu, Mousong; Zhang, Wenxin] Lund Univ, Dept Phys Geog & Ecosyst Sci, SE-22362 Lund, Sweden; [Ran, Youhua] Chinese Acad Sci, Cold & Arid Reg Environm & Engn Res Inst, Heihe Remote Sensing Expt Res Stn, Key Lab Remote Sensing Gansu Prov, Lanzhou, Gansu, Peoples R China; [Jansson, Per-Erik] KTH Royal Inst Technol, Dept Sustainable Dev Environm Sci & Engn, Stockholm, Sweden; [Chen, Peng] Hohai, State Key Lab Hydrol Water Resources & Hydraul En, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Chen, Peng] Joint Int Res Lab Global Change & Water Cycle, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Chen, Peng] Hohai Univ, Coll Hydrol & Water Resources, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Tan, Xiao] Sichuan Univ, Coll Water Resource & Hydropower, State Key Lab Hydraul & Mt River Engn, Chengdu 610065, Sichuan, Peoples R China",,"Zhang, WX (corresponding author), Lund Univ, Dept Phys Geog & Ecosyst Sci, SE-22362 Lund, Sweden.;Ran, YH (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Cold & Arid Reg Environm & Engn Res Inst, Heihe Remote Sensing Expt Res Stn, Key Lab Remote Sensing Gansu Prov, Lanzhou, Gansu, Peoples R China.",ranyh@lzb.ac.cn; wenxin.zhang@nateko.lu.se,"Ran, Youhua/Q-8041-2017; Jansson, Per-Erik/A-4856-2012","Ran, Youhua/0000-0001-7774-4612; Jansson, Per-Erik/0000-0002-9727-4037; Wu, Mousong/0000-0003-1141-3022; Zhang, Wenxin/0000-0001-9477-563X","National Key Research and Development Program of China [2016YFA0600204, 2017YFC0403304]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41471359]; Youth Innovation Promotion Association of Chinese Academy of Sciences [2016375]; Opening Research Foundation of the State Key Laboratory of Water Resources and Hydropower Engineering Science, Wuhan University [2017NSG02]","National Key Research and Development Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Youth Innovation Promotion Association of Chinese Academy of Sciences; Opening Research Foundation of the State Key Laboratory of Water Resources and Hydropower Engineering Science, Wuhan University","This study was jointly supported by National Key Research and Development Program of China (2016YFA0600204, 2017YFC0403304), National Natural Science Foundation of China projects (41471359), and the Youth Innovation Promotion Association of Chinese Academy of Sciences (Grant number: 2016375).

Data from Landsat 8 OLI were used to assess the correlation between spectral reflectance and different vegetation indices on one side, and aboveground biomass (AGB) derived from ground measurements on the other. AGB and CS (ton ha(-1)) were estimated using traditional destructive methods of standard sampling techniques and allometric equations developed in a previous study for date palms in the area. The relationships between the estimated AGB and parameters derived from remote sensing (RS) data were tested using single and multiple linear regression analysis. The results indicated a significant correlation with certain RS parameters. For mature palms class alone (>10 years), the correlation with single bands was only significant with SWIR1 and SWIR2 while the correlation was significant with all tested VI's except for TCB vegetation index. A combination of bands R, SWIR1, and SWIR2 improved the determination of this class to a coefficient of determination (R-2) value of 0.961. However, for the medium and young age classes (10-5 and less than 5 years), the correlation was not significant (with the exception of SWIR1 and TCB index for medium class), where the use of higher spatial resolution can be a good alternative. On the other hand, for mixed ages (young, medium and mature palms), the strongest correlations were found using SWIR2 single band and the SR vegetation index; having R-2 values of 0.753 and 0.871, respectively. The R-2 was improved to 0.952 by using stepwise multiple regression combining DVI, NDI, and RVI vegetation indices. Finally, results obtained showed that CS represented 53.87% of the total AGB in date palms. Subsequently, the average amount of carbon stock (CS) for both mature and mixed classes was calculated at 15.81 and 10.3 ton ha(-1) respectively.","[Issa, Salem; Dahy, Basam] United Arab Emirates Univ, Dept Geol, Al Ain, U Arab Emirates; [Saleous, Nazmi] United Arab Emirates Univ, Dept Geog, Al Ain, U Arab Emirates; [Ksiksi, Taoufik] United Arab Emirates Univ, Dept Biol, Al Ain, U Arab Emirates",,"Issa, S (corresponding author), United Arab Emirates Univ, Dept Geol, Al Ain, U Arab Emirates.",salem.essa@uaeu.ac.ae,"Ksiksi, TS/AAM-5921-2020","Ksiksi, TS/0000-0003-2598-1530; issa, salem/0000-0003-1706-5532",United Arab Emirates University - Research Affairs [31S247],United Arab Emirates University - Research Affairs,This work was supported by the United Arab Emirates University - Research Affairs [31S247].,,50,7,8,0,11,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0143-1161,1366-5901,,INT J REMOTE SENS,Int.

However, existing grid-based or non-grid-based digital soil mapping (DSM) can lead to the problem of mixed units of input information, which causes the mapping results to be unsuitable for direct use in guiding the implementation of precision agriculture. Instead, the goal of this study was to achieve DSM based on land parcels, which are the basic units of agricultural management and have practical geographical significance for precision mapping in agricultural areas. This study established a convolutional neural network-based automatic extraction model to extract land parcels from high resolution remote sensing images. Thirty environmental covariates were chosen and calibrated at land parcels to establish the relationships between soils and landscapes. Four prediction algorithms, namely, ordinary kriging, cokriging, random forest and artificial neural network, were combined with the land-parcel-based DSM framework to develop and evaluate their effectiveness in predicting four topsoil nutrient properties in an alluvial-diluvia plain agricultural region located in Ningxia province, China. The results of comparisons show that, overall, the land-parcel-based RF model achieved the best prediction accuracy; its relative improvement (RMSE%) values over the competing models were 1.27, 4.23, 3.19 and 9.01 for soil organic matter, soil total nitrogen, available phosphorus and available potassium, respectively. In addition, land-parcel-based mapping can improve algorithmic efficiency by approximately 4 times by effectively reducing the mapping units for complex agricultural areas compared with the grid-based mapping results when using the same algorithm, and it also achieves a better performance at the detail level. Overall, the land-parcel-based DSM approach achieved good results in plain agricultural areas, but the model still needs improvement for land-parcel-based DSM in mountainous and hilly agricultural areas, and a challenge remains in selecting the most appropriate environmental covariates.","[Dong, Wen; Luo, Jiancheng; Sun, Yingwei] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Remote Sensing & Digital Earth, State Key Lab Remote Sensing Sci, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Wu, Tianjun] Changan Univ, Coll Sci, Dept Math & Informat Sci, Xian 710064, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Xia, Liegang] Zhejiang Univ Technol, Coll Comp Sci & Technol, Hangzhou 310014, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",,"Luo, JC (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Remote Sensing & Digital Earth, 20 Datun Rd, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.",luojc@radi.ac.cn,,"Sun, Yingwei/0000-0002-3051-3259","National Key Research and Development Program, China [2017YFB0503600]; Beijing Municipal Natural Science Foundation, China [4172064]; National Natural Science Foundation of China, China [41631179]","National Key Research and Development Program, China; Beijing Municipal Natural Science Foundation, China(Beijing Natural Science Foundation); National Natural Science Foundation of China, China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC))","This work was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program, China [grant number 2017YFB0503600], Beijing Municipal Natural Science Foundation, China [grant number 4172064] and National Natural Science Foundation of China, China [grant number 41631179].",,75,29,32,9,91,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0016-7061,1872-6259,,GEODERMA,Geoderma,APR 15,2019,340,,,,,234,248,,10.1016/j.geoderma.2019.01.018,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2019.01.018,,15,Soil Science,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,HK4QW,,,,,2022-08-23

The conventional way to obtain AGB is to use destructive sampling methods that require manual harvesting of crops, weighing, and recording, which makes large-area, long-term measurements challenging and time consuming. However, with the diversity of platforms and sensors and the improvements in spatial and spectral resolution, remote sensing is now regarded as the best technical means for monitoring and estimating AGB over large areas.ResultsIn this study, we used structural and spectral information provided by remote sensing from an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) in combination with machine learning to estimate maize biomass. Of the 14 predictor variables, six were selected to create a model by using a recursive feature elimination algorithm. Four machine-learning regression algorithms (multiple linear regression, support vector machine, artificial neural network, and random forest) were evaluated and compared to create a suitable model, following which we tested whether the two sampling methods influence the training model. To estimate the AGB of maize, we propose an improved method for extracting plant height from UAV images and a volumetric indicator (i.e., BIOVP). The results show that (1) the random forest model gave the most balanced results, with low error and a high ratio of the explained variance for both the training set and the test set. (2) BIOVP can retain the largest strength effect on the AGB estimate in four different machine learning models by using importance analysis of predictors. (3) Comparing the plant heights calculated by the three methods with manual ground-based measurements shows that the proposed method increased the ratio of the explained variance and reduced errors.ConclusionsThese results lead us to conclude that the combination of machine learning with UAV remote sensing is a promising alternative for estimating AGB. This work suggests that structural and spectral information can be considered simultaneously rather than separately when estimating biophysical crop parameters.","[Han, Liang; Yang, Guijun; Yang, Hao; Li, Zhenhai; Yang, Xiaodong] Beijing Res Ctr Informat Technol Agr, Key Lab Quantitat Remote Sensing Agr, Minist Agr, Beijing 100097, Peoples R China; [Han, Liang] Shanxi Datong Univ, Coll Architecture & Geomat Engn, Datong 037003, Peoples R China; [Yang, Guijun; Xu, Bo; Yang, Hao; Feng, Haikuan; Li, Zhenhai; Yang, Xiaodong] Natl Engn Res Ctr Informat Technol Agr, Beijing 100097, Peoples R China; [Dai, Huayang] China Univ Min & Technol Beijing, Coll Geosci & Surveying Engn, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China",,"Yang, GJ; Yang, XD (corresponding author), Beijing Res Ctr Informat Technol Agr, Key Lab Quantitat Remote Sensing Agr, Minist Agr, Beijing 100097, Peoples R China.;Yang, GJ; Yang, XD (corresponding author), Natl Engn Res Ctr Informat Technol Agr, Beijing 100097, Peoples R China.",guijun.yang@163.com; yangxd@nercita.org.cn,"Li, Zhenhai/AAU-3396-2020","Li, Zhenhai/0000-0001-9878-3274; Feng, Haikuan/0000-0003-3312-6200; Yang, Guijun/0000-0002-6425-8321; Yang, Hao/0000-0001-8506-7295",National Key Research and Development Program of China [2016YFD0300602]; Natural Science Foundation of China [61661136003]; Beijing Natural Science Foundation [6182011]; Special Funds for Technology innovation capacity building - Beijing Academy of Agriculture and Forestry Sciences [KJCX20170423]; STFC [ST/N006801/1] Funding Source: UKRI,National Key Research and Development Program of China; Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Beijing Natural Science Foundation(Beijing Natural Science Foundation); Special Funds for Technology innovation capacity building - Beijing Academy of Agriculture and Forestry Sciences; STFC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Science & Technology Facilities Council (STFC)),"This study was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2016YFD0300602), the Natural Science Foundation of China (61661136003), the Beijing Natural Science Foundation (6182011), the Special Funds for Technology innovation capacity building sponsored by the Beijing Academy of Agriculture and Forestry Sciences (KJCX20170423).",,73,134,145,38,139,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",,1746-4811,,PLANT METHODS,Plant Methods,FEB 4,2019,15,,,,,,,10,10.1186/s13007-019-0394-z,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13007-019-0394-z,,19,Biochemical Research Methods; Plant Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Plant Sciences,HK3CF,30740136,"Green Published, gold",Y,N,2022-08-23

Soil texture is also used to calculate soil's ability to retain water for plant growth. SOC and soil texture are thus important parameters of agricultural soils and need to be regularly monitored. Optical satellite remote sensing offers the potential for frequent surveys over large areas. In addition, the recently-operated Sentinel-2 missions provide free imagery. This study compared the capabilities of Sentinel 2 for monitoring and mapping of SOC and soil texture (clay, silt and sand content) with those obtained from airborne hyperspectral (CASI/SASI sensors) and lab ASD FieldSpec spectroradiometer measurements at four agricultural sites in the Czech Republic. Combination of 10 extracted bands of the Sentinel-2 and 18 spectral indices, as independent variables, were used to train prediction models and then produce spatial distribution maps of the selected attributes. Results showed that the prediction accuracy based on lab spectroscopy, airborne and Sentinel-2 in the majority of the sites was adequate for SOC and fair for clay; however, Sentinel-2 imagery could not be used to detect and map variations in silt and sand. The SOC and clay maps derived from the airborne and spaceborne datasets showed similar trend, with both performing better where SOC levels were relatively high, though at the highest levels Sentinel-2 was able to create the SOC map more precisely than the airborne sensors. Taken across all SOC levels measured in the reference data, Sentinel-2 results were marginally lower than lab spectroscopy and airborne imagery, but this reduction in precision may be offset by the extensive geographical coverage and more frequent revisit characteristic of satellite observation. The increased temporal revisit and area are expected to be positive enhancements to the acquisition of high-quality information on variations in SOC and clay content of bare soils.","[Gholizadeh, Asa; Zizala, Daniel; Boruvka, Lubos] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Agrobiol Food & Nat Resources, Dept Soil Sci & Soil Protect, Prague 16500, Czech Republic; [Zizala, Daniel] Res Inst Soil & Water Conservat, Prague 15627, Czech Republic; [Saberioon, Mohammadmehdi] Univ South Bohemia Ceske Budejovice, Inst Complex Syst, Fac Fisheries & Protect Waters, South Bohemian Res Ctr Aquaculture & Biodivers Hy, Nove Hrady 37333, Czech Republic",,"Gholizadeh, A (corresponding author), Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Agrobiol Food & Nat Resources, Dept Soil Sci & Soil Protect, Prague 16500, Czech Republic.",gholizadeh@af.czu.cz,"Boruvka, Lubos/U-8869-2019; Saberioon, Mohammadmehdi/F-9258-2015; Zizala, Daniel/AAI-9121-2020; Gholizadeh, Asa/AAX-9152-2021","Boruvka, Lubos/0000-0001-5317-0933; Saberioon, Mohammadmehdi/0000-0003-1627-4957; Zizala, Daniel/0000-0002-7685-7604; ","Ministry of Agriculture of the Czech Republic project NAZV [QJ1610289]; Ministry of Agriculture of the Czech Republic project NAZV, Czechia [QK1720289]; Ministry of Education, Youth and Sport of the Czech Republic project CENAKVA [CZ.1.05/2.1.00/01.0024]; Ministry of Education, Youth and Sport of the Czech Republic project CENAKVA II, Czechia [LO1205]; Czech Science Foundation, Czechia [17-27726S]","Ministry of Agriculture of the Czech Republic project NAZV; Ministry of Agriculture of the Czech Republic project NAZV, Czechia; Ministry of Education, Youth and Sport of the Czech Republic project CENAKVA; Ministry of Education, Youth and Sport of the Czech Republic project CENAKVA II, Czechia; Czech Science Foundation, Czechia","The authors like to thank the partially financial support of the Ministry of Agriculture of the Czech Republic projects NAZV (project No. QJ1610289) and NAZV (project No. QK1720289), Czechia.

The carbon allocation of crops, however, remains relatively understudied compared to, for example, forests. For comprehensive consistent resource assessments or climate change impact studies large-scale reliable vegetation information is needed. Here, we demonstrate how robust data on carbon uptake in croplands can be obtained by combining multiple sources to enhance the reliability of estimates. Using yield statistics, a remote-sensing based productivity algorithm and climate-sensitive potential productivity, we mapped the potential to increase crop productivity and compared consistent carbon uptake information of agricultural land with forests. The productivity gap in Europe is higher in Eastern and Southern than in Central-Western countries. At continental scale, European agriculture shows a greater carbon uptake in harvestable compartments than forests (agriculture 1.96 vs. forests 1.76 t C ha(-1) year(-1)). Mapping productivity gaps allows efforts to enhance crop production to be prioritized by, for example, improved crop cultivars, nutrient management or pest control. The concepts and methods for quantifying carbon uptake used in this study are applicable worldwide and allow forests and agriculture to be included in future carbon uptake assessments.

While combining the different sources of information, positional errors can play a large role. For example, the spatial discrepancy between remote sensing images and field data can depend on many factors, including the positioning accuracy of ground-based observations. The accuracy of GPS receivers for the territory of Russia is approximately 3-10m. The aim of the study was to estimate the impact of sampling positioning accuracy on the relationship between soil organic carbon content and the infrared channel of the WorldView-2 satellite image and for mapping soil organic carbon contents in an agricultural field in the territory of the Bryansk Opolje (Russia). Intensive sampling of the topsoil took place. The positional accuracy was also measured and used to perturb the locations of the samples. The data were used to study: (i) the relationships between soil organic carbon and infrared reflectance, (ii) the variation in soil organic carbon through five different interpolation techniques, and (iii) the fraction of the fields with low soil organic matter contents. The study showed that the positional inaccuracies can have an important impact. The standardized methods to estimate the positional accuracy, perturb the locations and evaluate its impact seems to be an easy way to explore the quality of data.","[Samsonova, V. P.; Meshalkina, J.

Advantages and processes for global C sequestration in AF are unknown. We used a meta-analysis of 427 soil C stock data pairs grouped into four main AF systems-alley cropping, windbreaks, silvopastures, and homegardens-and evaluated changes in AF and adjacent control cropland or pasture. Mean soil C stocks in AF (1-m depth) were 126 Mg C center dot ha(-1), which is 19% more than that in cropland or pasture. The highest C stocks in soil were in subtropical homegardens, AF with younger trees, and topsoil (0-20 cm). Increased soil C stocks in AF were lower than aboveground C stocks in most AF systems, except alley cropping. Homegardens stored the highest C in both aboveground and belowground, especially in the subsoil (20-100 cm). Advantages of AF ecosystem services focusing on mechanisms of belowground C sequestration were analyzed. AF could store 5.3 x 10(9) Mg additional C in soil on 944 Mha globally, with most in the tropics and subtropics. AF systems could greatly contribute to global soil C sequestration if used in larger areas. Future investigations of AF should include (a) mechanistic- and process-based studies (instead of common monitoring and inventories), (b) models linking forest and crop growth with soil water and C and nutrient cycling, and (c) accurate assessments of the AF area worldwide based on the remote sensing approaches.","[Shi, Lingling; Xu, Jianchu] Chinese Acad Sci, Kunming Inst Bot, Key Lab Plant Divers & Biogeog East Asia, Kunming 650201, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Shi, Lingling; Xu, Jianchu] World Agroforestry Ctr, East & Cent Asia, Kunming 650201, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Shi, Lingling; Kuzyakov, Yakov] Univ Gottingen, Dept Soil Sci Temperate Ecosyst, Dept Agr Soil Sci, D-37707 Gottingen, Germany; [Feng, Wenting] Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Inst Agr Resources & Reg Planning, Natl Engn Lab Improving Qual Arable Land, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Kuzyakov, Yakov] Kazan Fed Univ, Inst Environm Sci, Kazan 420049, Russia; [Kuzyakov, Yakov] Soil Sci Consulting, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany",,"Kuzyakov, Y (corresponding author), Univ Gottingen, Dept Soil Sci Temperate Ecosyst, Dept Agr Soil Sci, D-37707 Gottingen, Germany.",kuzyakov@gwdg.de,"Kuzyakov, Yakov/D-1605-2010; Xu, Jianchu/Y-2890-2019; Feng, Wenting/D-9822-2016","Kuzyakov, Yakov/0000-0002-9863-8461; Feng, Wenting/0000-0002-3189-3687",Sino-German (CSC-DAAD) Postdoc Scholarship Program; Ministry of Sciences and Technology of China [2017YFC0505100],"Sino-German (CSC-DAAD) Postdoc Scholarship Program; Ministry of Sciences and Technology of China(Ministry of Science and Technology, China)","Sino-German (CSC-DAAD) Postdoc Scholarship Program; Key Project from the Ministry of Sciences and Technology of China, Grant/Award Number: 2017YFC0505100",,83,67,68,29,235,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1085-3278,1099-145X,,LAND DEGRAD DEV,Land Degrad.

A rapid, low-cost method to measure SOM content is needed to support the development of precision agriculture. This article studied the quantitative relationship between SOM and soil colour using a digital camera, which is relatively inexpensive and easy to operate, as a portable tool for obtaining colour information of the soil surface. The results show that mixed samples with different soil particle sizes reduce the noise of the image and are more suitable than uniform soil samples for predicting the SOM. Among the three bands of red, green, and blue (RGB), the red band had the best correlation with SOM, and its reciprocal correlation coefficient (r) reached 0.75. The reciprocal regression model of the RGB colour model provided good prediction results for mixed soil samples, with a coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.76 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.55, and the validation result had an excellent predictive ability (R-val(2) = 0.85 and RMSEval = 0.53). The single-variation predictive model of CIELa*b* colour space model through transformation of the RGB colour space model performed well. The model built by colour intensity values had a strong stability and forecasting capacity. Thus, a digital camera can be used as an alternative tool to rapidly measure SOM.","[Wu, Caiwu; Yang, Yue; Zhang, Yuecong; Cheng, Fuwei] Hebei Normal Univ Nationalities, Dept Resource & Environm Sci, Chengde, Peoples R China; [Xia, Jianxin] Minzu Univ China, Coll Life & Environm Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Yang, Hao] Peking Univ, Sch Econ, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Yang, Hao] Beijing Acad Social Sci, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China",,"Yang, H (corresponding author), Peking Univ, Sch Econ, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.;Yang, H (corresponding author), Beijing Acad Social Sci, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.",yanghaojldx@163.com,,,Projects of Scientific Technological Research and Development Plan of Chengde [20155004]; Colleges and Universities Scientific Research Project of Hebei Province [QN2016308]; Natural Science Foundation of Hebei Province [C2015101020],Projects of Scientific Technological Research and Development Plan of Chengde; Colleges and Universities Scientific Research Project of Hebei Province; Natural Science Foundation of Hebei Province(Natural Science Foundation of Hebei Province),This work was supported by the Projects of Scientific Technological Research and Development Plan of Chengde [20155004]; Colleges and Universities Scientific Research Project of Hebei Province [QN2016308]; Natural Science Foundation of Hebei Province [C2015101020].,,38,6,6,2,26,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0143-1161,1366-5901,,INT J REMOTE SENS,Int.

The determination of soil attributes to achieve the best decision making on land use planning is crucial. The use of remote sensing (satellite images) can improve understanding of the surface, since it collects a spectral reflectance fingerprint related to soil properties. However, methodologies still gather spatially fragmented information on bare soil in a single image; thus, there is still room to improve information as a continuous surface. This work has the purpose of developing a procedure using multi-temporal satellite image information, aiming to construct a single synthetic image which would represent soils. The work was carried out in the state of Sao Paulo, Brazil, on a site covering 14,614 km(2). The procedure, designated as Geospatial Soil Sensing System (GEOS3), is based on the following steps: a) creation of a database with Landsat 5 legacy data.; b) filtering of the database to provide images only from the dry season in the region; c) insertion of a set of rules into the system to filter other objects besides soils; d) Each bare soil occurrence for each location along the time-series was used to calculate a Temporal Synthetic Spectral Reflectance (TESS) of the soil surface; e) aggregation of all TESS composes the Synthetic Soil Image (SYSI); f) quantitative and qualitative validation of the SYSI through the correlation between laboratory and TESS, soil line assessment and the principal component analysis (PCA). GEOS3 was able to provide the best representative reflectance of soils for each band during the historical period. Thus, TESS is not the 'true' but a synthetic spectral reflectance. The canonical correlation between laboratory and satellite data reached 0.93. A value of up to 0.88 in the Pearson's correlation between laboratory and TESS was also achieved. In a single scene, only 0.5% of area was available as isolated bare soil for spatial analysis. However, SYSI reached 68%. Considering only the sugarcane agricultural areas, a value of 92% was achieved. Our study indicates that a multi-temporal data mining procedure can retrieve soil surface representation. The key to the results was calculating the median spectral reflectance from the bare soil pixels along the period of the time series. GEOS3 products can aid soil evaluation by assisting in digital soil mapping, soil security, precision agriculture, soil attribute quantification, soil conservation, environment monitoring and soil sample allocation, among others.","[Melo Dematte, Jose Alexandre; Fongaro, Caio Troula; Safanelli, Jose Lucas] Univ Sao Paulo, Dept Soil Sci, Luiz de Queiroz Coll Agr, Ave Padua Dias 11,Postal Code 09, BR-13416900 Piracicaba, SP, Brazil; [Rizzo, Rodnei] Univ Sao Paulo, Ctr Nucl Energy Agr, Centenario Ave 303, BR-13416000 Piracicaba, SP, Brazil",,"Dematte, JAM (corresponding author), Univ Sao Paulo, Dept Soil Sci, Luiz de Queiroz Coll Agr, Ave Padua Dias 11,Postal Code 09, BR-13416900 Piracicaba, SP, Brazil.",jamdemat@usp.br; caio.fongaro@usp.br; jose.lucas.safanelli@usp.br,"Safanelli, José Lucas/L-7594-2016; Rizzo, Rodnei/AAB-7693-2019; Demattê, José A.M./I-5990-2013","Safanelli, José Lucas/0000-0001-5410-5762; Demattê, José A.M./0000-0001-5328-0323; Rizzo, Rodnei/0000-0002-1637-2277","Sao Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP) [2013/18769-9, 2013/20377-1, 2014/22262-0, 2016/01597-9]; National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) [305080/2007-5, 130805/2014-9]; Brazilian Federal Agency for Support and Evaluation of Graduate Education (CAPES)",Sao Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP)(Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP)); National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq)(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); Brazilian Federal Agency for Support and Evaluation of Graduate Education (CAPES)(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)),"The financial support, which came from different Brazilian institutions, is hereby acknowledged: grants numbers 2013/18769-9, 2013/20377-1, 2014/22262-0, 2016/01597-9 from the Sao Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP), the grant numbers 305080/2007-5 and 130805/2014-9 from National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq), and the Brazilian Federal Agency for Support and Evaluation of Graduate Education (CAPES).

A key reason for this omission is the cost and uncertainty of monitoring C at the farm scale in heterogeneous smallholder landscapes. A largely overlooked alternative is to monitor C at more aggregated scales and develop C contracts with groups of land owners, community organizations or C aggregators working across entire landscapes (e.g., watersheds, communities, municipalities, etc.). In this study we use a 100-km(2) agricultural area in El Salvador to demonstrate how high-spatial resolution optical satellite imagery can be used to map aboveground woody biomass (AGWB) C at the landscape scale with very low uncertainty (95% probability of a deviation of less than 1%). Uncertainty of AGWB-C estimates remained low (<5%) for areas as small as 250 ha, despite high uncertainties at the farm and plot scale (34-99%). We estimate that CSA adoption could more than double AGWB-C stocks on agricultural lands in the study area, and that utilizing AGWB-C maps to target denuded areas could increase C gains per unit area by 46%. The potential value of C credits under a plausible adoption scenario would range from $38,270 to $354,000 yr(-1) for the study area, or about $13 to $124 ha(-1) yr(-1), depending on C prices. Considering farm sizes in smallholder landscapes rarely exceed 1-2 ha, relying solely on direct C payments to farmers may not lead to widespread CSA adoption, especially if farm-scale monitoring is required. Instead, landscape-scale approaches to C contracting, supported by satellite-based monitoring methods such as ours, could be a key strategy to reduce costs and uncertainty of C monitoring in heterogeneous smallholder landscapes, thereby incentivizing more widespread CSA adoption.

Remotely sensing optical and radar data can help to map crop types and to estimate biophysical parameters, especially with the availability of an unprecedented amount of free Sentinel data within the Copernicus programme. These datasets, whose continuity is guaranteed up to decades, offer a unique opportunity to monitor crops systematically every 5 to 10 days. Before developing operational monitoring methods, it is important to understand the temporal variations of the remote sensing signal of different crop types in a given region. In this study, we analyse the temporal trajectory of remote sensing data for a variety of winter and summer crops that are widely cultivated in the world (wheat, rapeseed, maize, soybean and sunflower). The test region is in southwest France, where Sentinel-1 data have been acquired since 2014. Because Sentinel -2 data were not available for this study, optical satellites similar to Sentinel-2 are used, mainly to derive NDVI, for a comparison between the temporal behaviors with radar data. The SAR backscatter and NDVI temporal profiles of fields with varied management practices and environmental conditions are interpreted physically. Key findings from this analysis, leading to possible applications of Sentinel-1 data, with or without the conjunction of Sentinel-2, are then described. This study points out the interest of SAR data and particularly the VH/VV ratio, which is poorly documented in previous studies. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

In this study, we used extensive field data and a 30-year chronosequence of Landsat images (1980-2010) to assess the effects of time since conversion of Cerrado into agriculture upon soil chemical attributes and soybean/corn yield in the Alto do Rio Verde watershed. We determined the rates of vegetation conversion into agriculture, the agricultural land use time since conversion, and the temporal changes in topsoil (0-20 cm soil depth) and subsurface (20-40 cm) chemical attributes of the soils. In addition, we investigated possible associations between fertilization/over-fertilization and land use history detected from the satellites. The results showed that 61.8% of the native vegetation in the Alto do Rio Verde watershed was already converted into agriculture with 31% of soils being used in agriculture for more than 30 years. While other fertilizers in cultivated soils (e.g., Ca+2, Mg+2, and P) have been compensated over time by soil management practices to keep crop yield high, large reductions in C-org (38%) and N-tot (29%) were observed in old cultivated areas. Furthermore, soybean and cornfields having more than 10 years of farming presented higher values of P and Mg+2 than the ideal levels necessary for plant development. Therefore, increased risks of over-fertilization of the soils and environmental contamination with these macronutrients were associated with soybean and cornfields having more than 10 years of farming, especially those with more than 30 years of agricultural land use.","[Trabaquini, Kleber] Rural Extens & Agr Res Inst Santa Catarina, Rod Admar Gonzaga,1347, BR-88034901 Florianopolis, SC, Brazil; [Galvao, Lenio Soares; Formaggio, Antonio Roberto; Oliveira e Cruz de Aragao, Luiz Eduardo] Natl Inst Space Res, Remote Sensing Div, Ave Astronautas,1758, BR-12227010 Sao Jose Dos Campos, SP, Brazil; [Oliveira e Cruz de Aragao, Luiz Eduardo] Univ Exeter, Coll Life & Environm Sci, Exeter EX4 4RJ, Devon, England",,"Trabaquini, K (corresponding author), Rural Extens & Agr Res Inst Santa Catarina, Rod Admar Gonzaga,1347, BR-88034901 Florianopolis, SC, Brazil.",klebertrabaquini@epagri.sc.gov.br; lenio.galvao@inpe.br; antonio.formaggio@inpe.br; luiz.aragao@inpe.br,"aragao, luiz eoc/G-8387-2012","aragao, luiz eoc/0000-0002-4134-6708; Galvao, Lenio/0000-0002-8313-0497",,,,,48,7,8,5,62,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0167-6369,1573-2959,,ENVIRON MONIT ASSESS,Environ.

Moreover, SOC depletion entails degradation of soil functions that support ecosystem services. Large areas covered by dry forests have been cleared in the Semiarid Chaco Region of Argentina for cropping expansion. However, deforestation impacts on the SOC stock and its distribution in the soil profile have been scarcely reported. We assessed these impacts based on the analysis of field data along a time-since-deforestation-for-cropping chronosequence, and remote sensing indices. Soil organic C was determined up to 100 cm depth and physically fractionated into mineral associated organic carbon (MAOC) and particulate organic C (POC). Models describing vertical distribution of SOC were fitted. Total SOC, POC and MAOC stocks decreased markedly with increasing cropping age. Particulate organic C was the most sensitive fraction to cultivation. After 10 yr of cropping SOC loss was around 30%, with greater POC loss (near 60%) and smaller MAOC loss (near 15%), at 0-30 cm depth. Similar relative SOC losses were observed in deeper soil layers (30-60 and 60-100 cm). Deforestation and subsequent cropping also modified SOC vertical distribution. Soil organic C loss was negatively associated with the proportion of maize in the rotation and total crop biomass inputs, but positively associated with the proportion of soybean in the rotation. Without effective land use polices, deforestation and agricultural expansion can lead to rapid soil degradation and reductions in the provision of important ecosystem services. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

This paper addresses the role of SOC as a component of a common functional unit in soil from analysis within a single field and over multiple fields. Soil data measured on the fields during the SMAPVEX12 satellite prelaunch algorithm development campaign exhibited high correlation among SOC, field-mean soil water content (SWC), bulk density, and soil texture. The analysis extended over a wide range of soil texture and wetness in the top 5 cm of soil over 50 agricultural fields covering similar to 400 km(2) of southern Manitoba. Data collected over a much smaller area from Ontario silt loam soils at the Elora Research Centre demonstrated a similar correlation between SOC and SWC in intensive field sampling. This intercorrelation of SOC and SWC is examined with partial least-squares regression, principal component analysis, and geostatistical semivariograms. A model is proposed to interpret the feedback process between SOC and SWC to explain the persistent correlation. Further work to substantiate the strengths and limits of the relationship between SOC and SWC may be beneficial for estimating SWC for remote sensing, agriculture, hydrology, and ecosystem function.","[Manns, Hida R.] Univ Guelph, Dept Geog, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada; [Parkin, Gary W.] Univ Guelph, Sch Environm Sci, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada; [Martin, Ralph C.] Univ Guelph, Dept Plant Agr, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada",,"Manns, HR (corresponding author), Univ Guelph, Dept Geog, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada.",hmanns@uoguelph.ca,,,,,,,60,18,19,7,49,CANADIAN SCIENCE PUBLISHING,OTTAWA,"65 AURIGA DR, SUITE 203, OTTAWA, ON K2E 7W6, CANADA",0008-4271,1918-1841,,CAN J SOIL SCI,Can.

The aim of this study was to investigate the potential of UAS (Unmanned Aerial Systems) multi-spectral imagery (480-1000 nm) for estimating the SOC content in bare cultivated soils at a high spatial resolution (12 cm). We performed UAS analysis on the Hoosfield Spring Barley experiment at Rothamsted (UK) where adjacent plots with distinctly different SOC contents, due to different long-term management practices, provide a valuable resource to evaluate this approach. We acquired images (wavelength: 480-550-670-780-880-1000 nm) at an altitude of 120 m over an area of 2 ha using a multi-spectral camera mounted on an UAS. The high-resolution images captured small-scale variations at the soil surface (e.g. shadows, tillage and wheels marks). After a projection in new dimensions by a PCA, we calibrated a support vector machine regression using observations from conventional soil sampling and SOC measurements. The performance of the calibration had a R-2 of 0.98 and a RMSE of 0.17%C. A cross validation showed that the model was robust, with an average R-2 of 0.95 and a RMSE of 0.21%. An external validation dataset was used to evaluate the predicted spatial patterns of SOC content and a good fit with an RMSE 0.26%C was obtained. Although this study shows that the methodology has a clear potential for use in precision agriculture or monitoring important soil properties following changes in management, we also identify and discuss its limitations and current shortcomings.

These impacts are greatly understudied, especially in biodiversity rich mountains in East Africa. The objectives of this study were to: conduct a biophysical baseline of soil and land health; assess the effects of cultivation on soil organic carbon (SOC); and develop a map of SOC at high resolution to enable farm-scale targeting of management interventions. Biophysical field surveys were conducted in a 100 km 2 landscape near Lushoto, Tanzania, with composite soil samples collected from 160 sampling plots. Soil erosion prevalence was scored, trees were counted, and current and historic land use was recorded at each plot. The results of the study showed a decline in SOC as a result of cultivation, with cultivated plots (n = 105) having mean topsoil OC of 30.6 g kg(-1), while semi-natural plots (n = 55) had 71 g OC kg(-1) in topsoil. Cultivated areas were also less variable in SOC than seminatural systems. Prediction models were developed for the mapping of SOC based on RapidEye remote sensing data for January 2014, with good model performance (RMSEPcal = 8.0 g kg(-1); RMSEPval = 10.5 g kg(-1)) and a SOC map was generated for the study. Interventions will need to focus on practices that increase SOC in order to enhance productivity and resilience of the farming system, in general. The high-resolution maps can be used to spatially target interventions as well as for monitoring of changes in SOC.","[Winowiecki, Leigh] Ctr Int Agr Trop, Nairobi, Kenya; [Vagen, Tor-Gunnar] World Agroforestry Ctr ICRAF, Nairobi, Kenya; [Massawe, Boniface] Ohio State Univ, Sch Environm & Nat Resources, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Massawe, Boniface] Sokoine Univ Agr, Dept Soil Sci, Morogoro, Tanzania; [Jelinski, Nicolas A.] Univ Minnesota Twin Cities, Dept Soil Water & Climate, Minneapolis, MN USA; [Lyamchai, Charles; Sayula, George] Selian Agr Res Inst, Arusha, Tanzania; [Msoka, Elizabeth] Lushoto Dist Council, Lushoto, Tanzania",,"Winowiecki, L (corresponding author), Ctr Int Agr Trop, Nairobi, Kenya.",l.a.winowiecki@cgiar.org,,"Vagen, Tor-Gunnar/0000-0002-8699-731X","CGIAR Research Program, Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS); International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD)","CGIAR Research Program, Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS)(CGIAR); International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD)","The fieldwork and soil analysis for the samples were funded by the CGIAR Research Program, Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS).

Therefore, reliable estimations of carbon sequestration and emission at the landscape level after land cover transition from forest, swidden agriculture and other land use types are needed. We reviewed studies on C stocks and dynamics in rubber plantations considering the contribution of aboveground and belowground biomass, soil organic matter, collected latex and other minor components. C sequestration occurred after conversion of arable land to rubber plantations while C losses usually prevailed if forest was converted to rubber. These general trends strongly depended on local climate conditions and soil properties as well as on topography. Non-traditional planting of rubber under subtropical conditions with a dryer climate and at high elevations (300-1000 m above sea level) decreased the C sequestration potential of rubber. We show how rotation length, rubber clone, and management strategies like tapping frequency or planting density affect C stocks, discuss the uncertainties in C stock estimation and highlight improved approaches. An important conclusion is that upscaling of C stocks and dynamics under different climate scenarios and rotation lengths to a regional level requires the use of time averaged C stocks. Enhanced remote sensing techniques can greatly improve C stock estimates at the regional level, allowing for an accounting of the variability caused by terrain and plantation properties. A partial life cycle assessment of rubber production revealed greenhouse gas emissions as a minor contribution when compared to land use change effects on plant and soil C stocks and C accumulation in latex, wood products and seed oil. The review highlights scantily explored topics and proposes directions for future studies, which should decrease uncertainties in C estimates in rubber dominated landscapes. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Soil maps were desirable for purposes of land valuation for taxation, agronomic planning, and even in military operations. Soil mapping required classification systems that would allow communication of mapped information, classification systems required understanding of the soil system, and gaining that understanding included the creation of soil models. Therefore, advancement in one of these highly interrelated areas tended to lead to corresponding advances in the others, and these relationships persist into the modem era. Although many advances in our understanding of the soil system have been made since the late 1800s, when soil science blossomed into a scientific discipline in its own right, there are still many unanswered questions and additional needs in soil mapping, classification, and pedologic modeling. New technologies including GPS, GIS, remote sensing, on-site geophysical instrumentation (EMI, GPR, PXRF, etc.), and the development of statistical and geostatistical techniques have greatly increased our ability to collect, analyze, and predict spatial information related to soils, but linking all of this new information to soil properties and processes can still be a challenge and enhanced pedologic models are needed. The expansion of the use of soil knowledge to address issues beyond agronomic production, such as land use planning, environmental concerns, food security, energy security, water security, and human health, to name a few, requires new ways to communicate what we know about the soils we map as well as bringing forth research questions that were not widely considered in earlier soils studies. At present this information is communicated using dozens of national soil classification systems as well as WRB, but a more universal soil classification system would facilitate international communication of soils information. There are still many significant needs in the area of soil mapping, classification, and pedologic modeling going into the future. (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Although surface roughness, vegetation and soil texture have been established as sources of variability in passive microwave interpretation, soil organic carbon (SOC) has not typically been considered as a factor that affects SWC estimation during field sampling campaigns. SOC was observed along with soil texture and bulk density during the Soil Moisture Active Passive Validation Experiment in 2012 (SMAPVEX12), the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite algorithm development field sampling campaign held June 6 to July 19 in Southern Manitoba, Canada. Aerial measurements from the PALS (Passive Active L-band System) instrument were recorded over agricultural fields and forest areas from aircraft while SWC was measured simultaneously on the ground with resistance probes on 17 sampling dates. Additionally, fields were sampled for surface roughness, vegetation growth and water content, soil and vegetation temperature and soil physical characteristics. A soil core was collected on each field each sampling time to assess bulk density, soil particle size and SOC. SOC accounted for more variability in the anomalies between PALS and ground sampled SWC than sand, clay or bulk density, although all soil variables explained significant variability. With analysis by partial least squares multiple regression over 11 sampling dates and 39 fields where both ground and PALS data were well represented, only SOC contributed significantly to the regression of SWC beyond the variance all soil variables had in common. The significance of SOC in the relative SWC anomalies was highest in very wet and very dry conditions and in loam soil over all sampling dates, while bulk density was more significant in sand soils. This analysis suggests SOC is a simple variable that incorporates multiple aspects of soil hydrology and may improve the algorithms for remotely sensing estimation of SWC in various landscapes.

On agricultural land, annual herbaceous vegetation is not considered a carbon sink, whereas perennial woody vegetation accumulates biomass over multiple years and does represent a carbon sink. This paper presents a study to estimate aboveground woody carbon stock in 1990 and its annual change from 1990 to 2000 on Canada's cropland. The cropland was stratified into zones according to soils, climate and cropping systems, within which sample plots were randomly selected and paired aerial photographs corresponding to circa 1990 and 2000 were interpreted to detect changes in perennial woody vegetation such as trees, shrubs, orchards and vineyards. Woody biomass volumes lost as a result of land use change and gained as a result of planting and growth were estimated using species composition and growth rates typical of each zone, as obtained from published literature, forest reports and charts and forestry expert knowledge. Census of agriculture data was used to scale up the sample level results to zone and national levels. Results showed that on Canada's cropland, the aboveground woody carbon stock in 1990 was 33.7 +/- 8.8 Tg. Between 1990 and 2000, the area covered by woody vegetation was affected negatively by removals and positively through planting and natural regeneration, leading to a net reduction in area. There was an annual increase of about 78.3 Gg over all cropland in Canada, with a net decrease in some ecozones. Although this is a comparatively small increase with a large uncertainty, it indicates that changes in woody carbon on cropland in Canada over the 1990-2000 period were relatively insignificant.

This would enable estimation of how much carbon emission a project could potentially prevent and thus how much carbon credit should be rewarded. However, different factors like forest degradation and the lack of linearity in forest cover transitions challenge the accuracy of such scenarios. Here we predict and validate such BAU scenarios retrospectively based on forest cover changes at village and district level in North Central Vietnam. With the government's efforts to increase the forest cover, land use policies led to gradual abandonment of shifting cultivation since the 1990s. We analyzed Landsat images from 1973, 1989, 1998, 2000, and 2011 and found that the policies in the areas studied did lead to increased forest cover after a long period of decline, but that this increase could mainly be attributed to an increase in open forest and shrub areas. We compared Landsat classifications with participatory maps of land cover/use in 1998 and 2012 that indicated more forest degradation than was captured by the Landsat analysis. The BAU scenarios were heavily dependent on which years were chosen for the reference period. This suggests that hypothetical REDD+ activities in the past, when based on the remote sensing data available at that time, would have been unable to correctly estimate changes in carbon stocks and thus produce relevant BAU scenarios.","[Ankersen, Jeppe; Grogan, Kenneth; Mertz, Ole; Fensholt, Rasmus; Rasmussen, Kjeld] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Geosci & Nat Resource Management, DK-1350 Copenhagen K, Denmark; [Castella, Jean-Christophe; Lestrelin, Guillaume] IRD, GRED, UMR 220, Viangchan, Lao PDR, Laos; [Nguyen, Dinh Tien] Vietnam Natl Univ Agr, Ctr Agr Res & Ecol Studies, Hanoi, Vietnam; [Danielsen, Finn; Brofeldt, Soren] NORDECO, DK-1159 Copenhagen K, Denmark",,"Mertz, O (corresponding author), Univ Copenhagen, Dept Geosci & Nat Resource Management, Oster Voldgade 10, DK-1350 Copenhagen K, Denmark.",om@ign.ku.dk,"Brofeldt, Søren/F-6718-2015; Lestrelin, Guillaume/A-8196-2012; Rasmussen, Kjeld/A-4212-2015; Castella, Jean-Christophe/A-7419-2008; Mertz, Ole/M-2482-2014; Fensholt, Rasmus/L-7951-2014","Brofeldt, Søren/0000-0003-3519-5648; Lestrelin, Guillaume/0000-0001-6207-218X; Rasmussen, Kjeld/0000-0003-3111-584X; Castella, Jean-Christophe/0000-0003-3532-0728; Mertz, Ole/0000-0002-3876-6779; Nguyen, Dinh Tien/0000-0002-2215-0830; Grogan, Kenneth/0000-0003-1257-6245; Fensholt, Rasmus/0000-0003-3067-4527","European Community's Seventh Framework Research Programme; Global Land Project, University of Copenhagen","European Community's Seventh Framework Research Programme; Global Land Project, University of Copenhagen","This research is part of the research project entitled Impacts of Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation and Enhancing Carbon Stocks (I-REDD+).

Using satellite images of 1999 and 2011, land use and land use changes in the Kumrat valley KPK, Pakistan, were determined: a net decrease of 11.56 and 7.46 % occurred in forest and rangeland, while 100 % increase occurred in agriculture land (AL). Biomass in different land uses, forest land (FL), AL, and range land (RL) was determined by field inventory. From the biomass data, the amount of carbon was calculated, considering 50 % of the biomass as carbon. Soil carbon was also determined to a depth of 0-15 and 16-30 cm. The average carbon stocks (C stocks) in all land uses ranged from 28.62 +/- A 13.8 t ha(-1) in AL to 486.6 +/- A 32.4 t ha(-1) in pure Cedrus deodara forest. The results of the study confirmed that forest soil and vegetation stored the maximum amount of carbon followed by RL. Conversion of FL and RL to AL not only leads to total loss of about 56 % (from FL conversion) and 37 % (RL conversion) of soil carbon in the last decades but also the loss of a valuable carbon sink. In order to meet the emissions reduction obligations of the Kyoto Protocol, Conservation of forest and RL in the mountainous regions of the Hindu Kush will help Pakistan to meet its emissions reduction goals under the Kyoto Protocol.","[Ahmad, Adnan] Shaheed Benazir Bhutto Univ, Sheringal 18050, Kpk, Pakistan; [Nizami, Syed Moazzam] Arid Agr Univ, Rawalpindi 46300, Punjab, Pakistan",,"Nizami, SM (corresponding author), Arid Agr Univ, Rawalpindi 46300, Punjab, Pakistan.",moazzam.nizami@uaar.edu.pk,"Nizami, Syed Moazzam/V-7754-2019",,,,,,27,35,38,1,22,NORTHEAST FORESTRY UNIV,HARBIN,"NO 26 HEXING RD, XIANGFANG DISTRICT, HARBIN, 150040, PEOPLES R CHINA",1007-662X,1993-0607,,J FORESTRY RES,J.

Frequent reclamation of wetlands and grasslands and intensive agricultural activity have induced significant changes in both land use/cover and soil physicochemical properties in the riparian zones of the middle Heihe River basin of China. The present study aims to explore whether land use/land cover change (LUCC) can well explain the variations in soil properties in the riparian zones of the middle Heihe River basin. To achieve this, we mapped LUCC and quantified the type of land use change using remote sensing images, topographic maps, and GIS analysis techniques. Forty-two sites were selected for soil and vegetation sampling. Then, physical and chemical experiments were employed to determine soil moisture, soil bulk density, soil pH, soil organic carbon, total nitrogen, total potassium, total phosphorous, available nitrogen, available potassium, and available phosphorous. The Independent-Samples Kruskal-Wallis Test, principal component analysis, and a scatter matrix were used to analyze the effects of LUCC on soil properties. The results indicate that the majority of the parameters investigated were affected significantly by LUCC. In particular, soil moisture and soil organic carbon can be explained well by land cover change and land use change, respectively. Furthermore, changes in soil moisture could be attributed primarily to land cover changes. Changes in soil organic carbon were correlated closely with the following land use change types: wetlands-arable, forest-grasslands, and grasslands-desert. Other parameters, including pH and total K, were also found to exhibit significant correlations with LUCC. However, changes in soil nutrients were shown to be induced most probably by human agricultural activity (i.e. fertilize, irrigation, tillage, etc.), rather than by simple conversions from one land use/cover types to the others.

However, under current climatic conditions, Ireland is situated on the margin of the geographical range where Miscanthus production is economically feasible. It is therefore important to optimize the yield and other ecosystem services such as carbon sequestration delivered by the crop. A survey of commercial Miscanthus fields showed a large number of areas with no Miscanthus crop cover. These patches can potentially lead to reduced crop yields and soil carbon sequestration and have a significant negative impact on the economic viability of the crop. The aim of this research is to assess patchiness on a field scale and to analyse the impacts on crop yield and soil carbon sequestration. Analysis of aerial photography images was carried out on six commercial Miscanthus plantations in south east Ireland. The analysis showed an average of 372.5 patches per hectare, covering an average of 13.7% of the field area. Using net present value models and a financial balance approach it was shown that patchiness has a significant impact on payback time for initial investments and might reduce gross margins by more than 50%. Total and Miscanthus-derived soil organic carbon was measured in open patches and adjacent plots of high crop density showing significantly lower Miscanthus-derived carbon stocks in open patches compared to high crop-density patches (0.47Mg Cha(-1)+/- 0.42 SD and 0.91Mg Cha(-1)+/- 0.55 SD). Using geographic information system (GIS) it was shown that on a field scale Miscanthus-derived carbon stocks were reduced by 7.38%+/- 7.25 SD. However, total soil organic carbon stocks were not significantly different between open patches and high crop density plots indicating no impact on the overall carbon sequestration on a field scale over 3-4years since establishment for these Miscanthus sites.","[Zimmermann, Jesko; Jones, Michael B.] Trinity Coll Dublin, Coll Green, Sch Nat Sci, Dept Bot, Dublin 2, Ireland; [Styles, David] Bangor Univ, Sch Environm Nat Resources & Geog, Bangor LL57 2UW, Gwynedd, Wales; [Hastings, Astley] Univ Aberdeen, Inst Biol & Environm Sci, Aberdeen, Scotland; [Dauber, Jens] Thunen Inst Biodivers, D-38116 Braunschweig, Germany",,"Zimmermann, J (corresponding author), Trinity Coll Dublin, Coll Green, Sch Nat Sci, Dept Bot, Dublin 2, Ireland.",zimmerjr@tcd.ie,,"Styles, David/0000-0003-4185-4478; Hastings, Astley/0000-0001-9863-7613; Zimmermann, Jesko/0000-0003-2143-1232","project SIMBIOSYS as part of the Science, Technology, Research and Innovation for the Environment (STRIVE) Programme - Irish Government under the National Development Plan [2007-B-CD-1-S1]","project SIMBIOSYS as part of the Science, Technology, Research and Innovation for the Environment (STRIVE) Programme - Irish Government under the National Development Plan","We thank the landowners who granted us access to their property.

Net primary productivity (NPP) provides the inputs of C in ecosystems that can potentially be sequestered in soil organic matter. In this study, we estimates the C density and accumulation rate in rice-wheat agroecosystem at four sites of Indo-Gangetic Plains and Vindhyan highlands through amalgamation of ground truth (GT) and remote sensing (RS) approach. In addition to this, we validated field-measured aboveground net production (ANP) with remotely sensed SPOT-Vegetation data. ANP of the sites ranged from 6.8 to 11.1 and 3.3 to 8.8 t-C ha(-1) year(-1) for GT and RS, respectively. Both estimates (GT and RS) were linearly and significantly related with each other (y = 1.33x -aEuro parts per thousand 5.82, R (2) = 0.93, P = 0.04; where x = GT ANP and y = RS ANP). For the whole region, total NPP (rice + wheat) was ranged from 7.9 to 12.5 t-C ha(-1) year(-1). The C accumulation potential of the present agroecosystems was 9.1 and 1.9 t-C ha(-1) year(-1) in the form of ANP and belowground NPP (BNP), respectively. The aboveground C stock of agroecosystem allocated in foliage (7.8 %), stem (57.6 %), and grain (35.1 %). Survey about the fate of post-harvested materials indicated that aboveground portion of the crop is almost used completely within the year for different purposes including human consumption and cattle feeding. Therefore, only BNP and litter contribute to long-term C sequestration. Since agroecosystem has enormous potential to sequester C, better management of aboveground portion NPP of the crop may enhance C sequestration potential of agroecosystem.","[Kumar, Manoj] Banaras Hindu Univ, Ctr Adv Study Bot, Dept Bot, Ecosyst Anal Lab, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Singh, R.

Carbon sequestration by terrestrial plants is a key factor to a comprehensive understanding of the carbon budget at global scale. In this context, accurate measurements and estimates of GPP will allow us to achieve improved carbon monitoring and to quantitatively assess impacts from climate changes and human activities. Spacebome remote sensing observations can provide a variety of land surface parameterizations for modeling photosynthetic activities at various spatial and temporal scales. This study utilizes a simple GPP model based on LUE concept and different land surface parameterizations to evaluate the model and monitor GPP. Two maize-soybean rotation fields in Nebraska, USA and the Bartlett Experimental Forest in New Hampshire, USA were selected for study. Tower-based eddy-covariance carbon exchange and PAR measurements were collected from the FLUXNET Synthesis Dataset. For the model parameterization, we utilized different values of LUE and the fPAR derived from various algorithms. We adapted the approach and parameters from the MODIS MOD17 Biome Properties Look-Up Table (BPLUT) to derive LUE. We also used a site-specific analytic approach with tower-based Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE) and PAR to estimate maximum potential LUE (LUEmax.) to derive LUE. For the fPAR parameter, the MODIS MOD 15A2 fPAR product was used. We also utilized fAPAR(chl), a parameter accounting for the fAPAR linked to the chlorophyll-containing canopy fraction. fAPAR(chl) was obtained by inversion of a radiative transfer model, which used the MODIS-based reflectances in bands 1-7 produced by Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) algorithm. fAPAR(chl) exhibited seasonal dynamics more similar with the flux tower based GPP than MOD15A2 fPAR, especially in the spring and fall at the agricultural sites. When using the MODIS MOD17-based parameters to estimate LUE, fAPAR(chl) generated better agreements with GPP (r(2) = 0.79-0.91) than MOD15A2 fPAR (r(2) = 0.57-0.84). However, underestimations of GPP were also observed, especially for the crop fields. When applying the site-specific LUEmax value to estimate in situ LUE, the magnitude of estimated GPP was closer to in situ GPP; this method produced a slight overestimation for the MOD15A2 fPAR at the Bartlett forest. This study highlights the importance of accurate land surface parameterizations to achieve reliable carbon monitoring capabilities from remote sensing information. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

China has launched an ambitious national ecosystem restoration program called Grain to Green Program (GTGP) over the last decade. By using remote sensing techniques and ecosystem modelling, we quantitatively evaluated the changes in ecosystem carbon sequestration since China's GTGP program during period of 2000-2008. It was found the NPP and NEP in this region had steadily increased after the initiative of the GTGP program, and a total of 96.1 Tg of additional carbon had been sequestered during that period. Changes in soil carbon storage were lagged behind and thus insignificant over the period, but was expected to follow in the coming decades. As a result, the Loess Plateau ecosystem had shifted from a net carbon source in 2000 to a net carbon sink in 2008. The carbon sequestration efficiency was constrained by precipitation, and appropriate choices of restoration types (trees, shrubs, and grasses) in accordance to local climate are critical for achieving the best benefit/cost efficiency.","[Feng, Xiaoming; Fu, Bojie; Lu, Nan] Chinese Acad Sci, Ecoenvironm Sci Res Ctr, State Key Lab Urban & Reg Ecol, Beijing 100085, Peoples R China; [Zeng, Yuan; Wu, Bingfang] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Remote Sensing & Digital Earth, Beijing 100094, Peoples R China",,"Fu, BJ (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Ecoenvironm Sci Res Ctr, State Key Lab Urban & Reg Ecol, Beijing 100085, Peoples R China.",bfu@rcees.ac.cn,"Fu, Bojie/B-1493-2009; Wu, Bingfang/AAD-7223-2022",,National Basic Research Program of China [2009CB421104]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41230745]; External Cooperation Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [GJHZ1215],National Basic Research Program of China(National Basic Research Program of China); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); External Cooperation Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences),"We thank Prof. Shilong Piao for the comments and suggestions on the manuscript.

However, quantifying and understanding the cropland C cycle are complex, due to variable environmental drivers, varied management practices and often highly heterogeneous landscapes. Efforts to upscale processes using simulation models must resolve these challenges. In this study we show how data assimilation (DA) approaches can link C cycle modelling to Earth observation (EO) and reduce uncertainty in upscaling. We evaluate a framework for the assimilation of leaf area index (LAI) time-series, derived from EO optical and radar sensors, for state-updating a model of crop development and C fluxes. Sensors are selected with fine spatial resolutions (20-50 m) to resolve variability across field sizes typically used in European agriculture (1.5-97.6 ha). Sequential DA is used to improve the canopy development simulation, which is validated by comparing time-series of net ecosystem exchange (NEE) predictions to independent eddy covariance observations at multiple European cereal crop sites. From assimilating all EO LAI estimates, results indicated adjustments in LAI and, through an enhanced representation of C exchanges, the predicted at-harvest cumulative NEE was improved for all sites by an average of 69% when compared to the model without DA. However, using radar sensors, being relatively unaffected by cloud cover and more sensitive to the structural properties of crops, further improvements were achieved when compared to the combined, and individual, use of optical data. Specifically, when assimilating radar LAI estimates only, the cumulative NEE estimation was improved by 79% when compared to the simulation without DA. Future developments would include the assimilation of additional state variables, such as soil moisture. (c) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Carbon storage in ecosystems in China has been estimated using inventory and modeling methods in the past two decades. However, different methods may result in varied magnitudes and forms of carbon storage. In this study, the current status of carbon storage in terrestrial ecosystems in China, including the impacts of land use, is summarized in the national, regional, and biome scales. Significant differences in data have existed among studies. Such differences are mainly attributed to variations in estimation methods, data availability, and periods. According to available national-scale information on Chinese terrestrial ecosystems, vegetation carbon in China is 6.1 Pg C to 76.2 Pg C (mean 36.98 Pg C) and soil carbon is 43.6 Pg C to 185.7 Pg C (mean 100.75 Pg C). The forest sector has vegetation carbon of 3.26 Pg C to 9.11 Pg C (mean 5.49 Pg C), whereas the grassland sector has 0.13 Pg C to 3.06 Pg C (mean 1.41 Pg C). Soil carbon in the forest and grassland sectors exhibits more significant regional variations. Further studies need a comprehensive methodology, which combines national inventory, field measurement, eddy covariance technique, remote sensing, and model simulation in a single framework, as well as all available data at different temporal and spatial scales, to fully account for the carbon budget in China.","Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geochem, State Key Lab Environm Geochem, Guiyang 550002, Guizhou Provinc, Peoples R China",,"Ni, J (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geochem, State Key Lab Environm Geochem, Guanshui Rd 46, Guiyang 550002, Guizhou Provinc, Peoples R China.",nijian@vip.skleg.cn,"Ni, Jian/I-7067-2012","Ni, Jian/0000-0001-5411-7050",National Basic Research Program of China [2013CB956704]; Hundred Talents Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences,National Basic Research Program of China(National Basic Research Program of China); Hundred Talents Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences),This research was funded by the National Basic Research Program of China (2013CB956704) and the Hundred Talents Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.

A total of seven flights between summer and autumn were conducted with a hyperspectral camera that captured 30 cm resolution imagery and 260 spectral bands in the 400-900 nm region. This enabled the identification of pure-vegetation tree crown pixels around an eddy covariance flux tower without shadow components or background effects. The hyperspectral imagery was used to study the temporal patterns of canopy fluorescence and reflectance indices related to physiology and canopy structure. The seasonal trends observed in the airborne indices and fluorescence and their relationship with gross primary production (GPP) demonstrated that vegetation indices mostly related to structure such as the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) yielded non-significant relationships (r(2) = 0.17; p > 0.05) due to the small structural changes in the canopy through the season. By contrast, physiological indices related to chlorophyll content (TCARI/OSAVI), light use efficiency (PRI570), and canopy chlorophyll fluorescence calculated through the Fraunhofer Line Depth principle (FLD3) showed a similar seasonal trend to that of GPP measured at the same time of the flights (r(2) in the range 0.75-0.84; p < 0.01). These results are consistent with the physiological trend observed during summer and autumn, which showed that chlorophyll content increased by 17.9% while the NDVI and the estimated tree crown projected LAI (LAI(p)) remained almost constant during the experiment (3% variation). The time-series hyperspectral dataset demonstrated that the seasonal trajectories of the NDVI and EVI were weakly related (p > 0.05) to the physiological indicators such as TCARI/OSAVI, PRI570 and fluorescence. The spatial variability of the hyperspectral indices investigated through the coefficient of variation (CV) showed that fluorescence around the tower varied up to 17% at the time of the maximum stress (summer), while LAI(p) showed little variation during that time (CV = 1.8%). After the summer stress period, the CV for fluorescence and chlorophyll content decreased in autumn down to 9%. This study demonstrates that small physiological changes occurring in an evergreen canopy were still captured by remote sensing physiological indices and high-resolution airborne fluorescence. These indicators are required for GPP monitoring when the vegetation dynamics are not captured by remote sensing structural indices. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.","[Zarco-Tejada, P.

Although the consequences of soil quality reduction are generally recognized, the spatial extent of soil degradation is difficult to determine, because no universal equation or soil quality prediction model exists that fits all ecoregions. Furthermore, existing soil organic C (SOC) models generate estimates with uncertainties that may exceed 50%. Therefore it is possible that drastic changes in soil quality may be occurring in sites which are not identifiable on existing maps. Soil quality can either be directly inferred from SOC concentration, or through the assessment of the soil physical, chemical and biologic properties. Assessing the spatial distribution of SOC over large areas requires the calibration and development of models derived from laboratory or field based techniques. However, mapping SOC concentration in all soils is logistically challenging by using normal standard survey techniques. The availability of new generations of remotely sensed datasets and geographical information system (GIS) models (i.e. GEMS, RothC, and CENTURY) provides new opportunities for predicting soil properties and quality at different spatial scales. This article discusses the current approaches, identifies gaps and proposes improvements in techniques for measuring soil quality within agricultural fields. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Agricultural wetlands have more complicated carbon and nitrogen cycles with both above- and below-ground processes and export of carbon via vertical and horizontal movement of water through the wetland. This letter reviews current research methodologies in estimating greenhouse gas production and provides guidance on the provision of robust estimates of carbon sequestration and greenhouse gas emissions in agricultural wetlands through the use of low cost reliable and sustainable measurement, modelling and remote sensing applications. The guidance is highly applicable to, and aimed at, wetlands such as those in the tropics and sub-tropics, where complex research infrastructure may not exist, or agricultural wetlands located in remote regions, where frequent visits by monitoring scientists prove difficult. In conclusion, the proposed measurement-modelling approach provides guidance on an affordable solution for mitigation and for investigating the consequences of wetland agricultural practice on GHG production, ecological resilience and possible changes to agricultural yields, variety choice and farming practice.","[Lloyd, Colin R.] Ctr Ecol & Hydrol, Wallingford OX10 8BB, Oxon, England; [Rebelo, Lisa-Maria] Int Water Management Inst, Southeast Asia Reg Off, Viangchan, Laos; [Finlayson, C.

Land management practices play a major role in determining global yield variability, and add an anthropogenic signal to the observed seasonality of atmospheric CO2 concentrations. However, there is still little knowledge on spatial and temporal variability of important farmland activities such as crop sowing dates, and thus these remain rather crudely approximated within carbon cycle studies. In this study, we present a framework allowing for spatiotemporally resolved simulation of cropland carbon fluxes under observational constraints on land management and canopy greenness. We apply data assimilation methodology in order to explicitly account for information on sowing dates and model leaf area index. MODIS 250m vegetation index data were assimilated both in batch-calibration for sowing date estimation and sequentially for improved model state estimation, using the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF), into a crop carbon mass balance model (SPAc). In doing so, we are able to quantify the multiannual (2000-2006) regional carbon flux and biometry seasonality of maize-soybean crop rotations surrounding the Bondville Ameriflux eddy covariance site, averaged over 104 pixel locations within the wider area. (1) Validation at the Bondville site shows that growing season C cycling is simulated accurately with MODIS-derived sowing dates, and we expect that this framework allows for accurate simulations of C cycling at locations for which ground-truth data are not available. Thus, this framework enables modellers to simulate current (i.e. last 10 yr) carbon cycling of major agricultural regions. Averaged over the 104 field patches analysed, relative spatial variability for biometry and net ecosystem exchange ranges from similar to 7% to similar to 18 %. The annual sign of net biome productivity is not significantly different from carbon neutrality. (2) Moreover, observing carbon cycling at one single field with its individual sowing pattern is not sufficient to constrain large-scale agroecosystem carbon flux seasonality. Study area average growing season length is 20 days longer than observed at Bondville, primarily because of an earlier estimated start of season. (3) For carbon budgeting, additional information on cropland soil management and belowground carbon cycling has to be considered, as such constraints are not provided by MODIS.","[Sus, O.; Williams, M.] Univ Edinburgh, Sch GeoSci, Edinburgh EH9 3JN, Midlothian, Scotland; [Sus, O.; Williams, M.] Univ Edinburgh, SAGES, Edinburgh EH9 3JN, Midlothian, Scotland; [Heuer, M.

The main causes of degradation include unsustainable logging, agriculture, invasive species, fire, fuelwood gathering, and livestock grazing. Forest degradation is widespread and has become an important consideration in global policy processes that deal with biodiversity, climate change, and forest management. There is, however, no generally recognized way to identify a degraded forest because perceptions of forest degradation vary depending on the cause, the particular goods or services of interest, and the temporal and spatial scales considered. Here, we suggest that there are types of forest degradation that produce a continuum of decline in provision of ecosystem services, from those in primary forests through various forms of managed forests to deforestation. Forest degradation must be measured against a desired baseline condition, and the types of degradation can be represented using five criteria that relate to the drivers of degradation, loss of ecosystem services and sustainable management, including: productivity, biodiversity, unusual disturbances, protective functions, and carbon storage. These criteria are not meant to be equivalent and some might be considered more important than others, depending on the local forest management objectives. We propose a minimum subset of seven indicators for the five criteria that should be assessed to determine forest degradation under a sustainable ecosystem management regime. The indicators can be remotely sensed (although improving calibration requires ground work) and aggregated from stand to management unit or landscape levels and ultimately to sub-national and national scales.","[Okabe, Kimiko] FFPRI Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan; [Bahamondez, Carlos] INFOR Valdivia, Valdivia, Chile; [Heymell, Victoria; Sabogal, Cesar] FAO Rome, Rome, Italy",,,,"Nasi, Robert/P-2382-2019; Nasi, Robert/A-3549-2015","Nasi, Robert/0000-0001-9739-3135; Nasi, Robert/0000-0001-9739-3135",United Nations FAO Forestry Department; Secretariat to the Convention on Biological Diversity; CGIAR Research Program; Global Environment Research Fund [S9],United Nations FAO Forestry Department; Secretariat to the Convention on Biological Diversity; CGIAR Research Program(CGIAR); Global Environment Research Fund,"We thank the United Nations FAO Forestry Department and especially M.

Sensor data fusion can potentially overcome this inability of a single sensor and can best extract useful and complementary information from multiple sensors or sources. In this study, a data fusion was performed of a Vis-NIR spectrometer and an EM38 sensor for multiple soil properties. Stepwise multiple linear regression (SMLR), partial least squares regression (PLSR) and principal components analysis combined with stepwise multiple linear regression (PCA + SMLR) methods were used in three different fields. Soil properties investigated for data fusion included soil texture (clay, silt and sand), EC, pH, total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN) and carbon to nitrogen ratio (CN). It was found that soil property models based on fusion methods significantly improved the accuracy of predictions of soil properties measureable by both sensors, such as clay, silt, sand, EC and pH from those based on either of the individual sensors. The accuracy of predictions of TOC, TN and CN was also improved in some cases, but was not consistent in all fields. Among data fusion methods, PLSR outperformed both SMLR and PCA + SMLR methods because it proved to have a better ability to deal with the multi-collinearity among the predictor variables of both sensors. The best data fusion results were found in a clayey field and the worst in a sandy field. It is concluded that sensor data fusion can enhance the quality of soil sensing in precision agriculture once a proper set of sensors has been selected for fusion to estimate desired soil properties. More efficient statistical data analysis methods are needed to handle a large volume of data effectively from multiple sensors for sensor data fusion.","[Mahmood, Hafiz S.; Hoogmoed, Willem B.; van Henten, Eldert J.] Wageningen Univ, Farm Technol Grp, NL-6700 AH Wageningen, Netherlands",,"Mahmood, HS (corresponding author), Wageningen Univ, Farm Technol Grp, POB 317, NL-6700 AH Wageningen, Netherlands.",sultan.mahmood@wur.nl,"Hoogmoed, Willem B/C-5944-2008; van Henten, Eldert J./K-8864-2019","van Henten, Eldert J./0000-0002-1623-9855","Higher Education Commission (HEC), Pakistan","Higher Education Commission (HEC), Pakistan(Higher Education Commission of Pakistan)","We acknowledge Higher Education Commission (HEC), Pakistan, for supporting this research and providing a PhD scholarship under the Overseas Scholarship Programme, Phase-II, Batch-I.",,27,41,41,1,90,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1385-2256,1573-1618,,PRECIS AGRIC,Precis.

C dynamics has been identified as a key intermediate or support ecosystem service that is profoundly altered by agricultural practices. The temperate grasslands of Argentina, the Pampas, are one of the main crop production regions of the world. Crop sequence, tillage and fertilization change inputs and outputs and, consequently the whole C dynamics. Our objectives in this article were (i) to provide a spatially explicit characterization, based on remotely sensed data, of crop sequences and tillage systems in the Rolling Pampas, (ii) to evaluate changes in C gains by computing the absorbed photosynthetic active radiation (APAR) from NDVI data of different crop, (iii) to evaluate the soil organic carbon (SOC) balance of different management schemes (crop sequence, conventional tillage vs. no till and three levels of nitrogen fertilization) using the CENTURY model, and (iv) to estimate the changes in SOC at a regional level. The results showed that 54% of the area was under continuous agriculture, with only two crop rotations occupying 61% of the area, and the main tillage system was no-tillage (73% of the area analyzed). Annual APAR was lower in crops than in rangelands, except for wheat-soybean double crop. Based on CENTURY simulations the crop management which had a most negative SOC balance (SOC reference value (100%) = 79 t ha(-1)) was crop sequence maize/soybean under conventional tillage and with no fertilizer application (37% losses of SOC in 60 years). The management that presented the most positive SOC balance was soybean/wheat-soybean double crop (6 years) pasture (4 years) under no till and with high fertilization (10% increase of SOC in 60 years). A positive and linear relationship was found between APAR estimates derived from satellite data and simulated SOC providing basis for a quantitative hypothesis on the importance of C inputs on SOC's dynamics. At regional scale, if crop sequences proportions remain constant, the lost of SOC would average a 15% in 60 years. (C) 2011 Elsevier BM.

This study examines the feasibility of two statistical learning algorithms, namely the least square support vector machine (LSSVM) and relevance vector machine (RVM), for identifying two contrasting tillage management practices using remote-sensing data. LSSVM is firmly based on statistical learning theory, whereas RVM is a probabilistic model where the training takes place in a Bayesian framework. Input to the LSSVM and RVM algorithms were reflectance values at different bandwidths and indices derived from Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) data. Ground-truth data for this study were collected from 72 commercial production fields in two counties located in the Texas High Plains of the south-central USA. Numerous LSSVM- and RVM-based tillage models were developed and evaluated for tillage classification accuracy. The percentage correct and kappa statistic were used for the evaluation. The results showed that the best LSSVM and RVM models included the use of TM band 5 or vegetation indices that involved TM band 5, indicating sensitivity of near-infrared reflectance of crop residue cover on the surface. This is consistent with other remote-sensing models reported in the literature. Overall classification accuracies of the best LSSVM and RVM models were 87.8 and 90.2%, respectively. The corresponding kappa statistics for those models were 0.75 and 0.80, respectively. Furthermore, comparison of the best LSSVM and RVM models with the published logistic regression-based tillage models developed with the same data indicated the superiority of the RVM model over LSSVM and logistic regression models in determining contrasting tillage practices with Landsat TM data.","[Gowda, Prasanna H.; Howell, Terry A.] USDA ARS, Conservat & Prod Res Lab, Bushland, TX 79012 USA; [Samui, Pijush] VIT Univ, Ctr Disaster Mitigat & Management, Vellore 632014, Tamil Nadu, India; [Oommen, Thomas] Michigan Technol Univ, Dept Geol & Min Engn & Sci, Houghton, MI 49931 USA; [Marek, Thomas H.] Texas A&M Univ, Texas AgriLife Res, Amarillo, TX 79106 USA; [Porter, Dana O.] Texas A&M Univ, Texas AgriLife Res, Lubbock, TX 79403 USA",,"Gowda, PH (corresponding author), USDA ARS, Conservat & Prod Res Lab, PO Drawer 10, Bushland, TX 79012 USA.",Gowda@ars.usda.gov,"samui, pijush/W-5860-2019",", pijush/0000-0001-7359-8718; samui, pijush/0000-0003-2906-6479",,,,,34,7,7,3,15,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0143-1161,1366-5901,,INT J REMOTE SENS,Int.
