Measurements of carbon fluxes from agricultural fields using micrometeorological techniques such as eddy covariance can improve our understanding of management and weather-driven changes in carbon budgets. In-situ carbon flux data are also valuable in developing remote sensing-based models for extrapolation of biome-specific carbon budgets to higher spatial scales. In this study, net ecosystem carbon dioxide exchange (NEE) was continuously measured for two years (2017 and 2018) from a cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) field in College Station, Texas, USA. The measured NEE was partitioned into assimilatory (Gross Primary Production, GPP) and respiratory (Ecosystem respiration, R-eco) fluxes. There were substantial differences in carbon fluxes between the two years, which were driven by variations in meteorological conditions and growth of weeds. Due to dry conditions, growing season carbon uptake in 2018 was reduced (883 g C m(-2)) compared to 2017 (947 g C m(-2)). While the growing season of 2018 was dry, the postharvest off-season was remarkably wet with nearly 68% of the annual precipitation occurring after harvest (848 mm). This favored aggressive growth of weeds, resulting in substantial off-season carbon uptake in 2018 (374 g C m(-2) in 2018 compared to 100 g C m(-2) in 2017). Overall, the site was a net carbon source (175 g C m(-2)) in 2017, whereas it was a slight carbon sink (-5 g C m(-2)) in 2018. A significant correlation was found between satellite-derived normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and GPP (R-2 0.78 in 2017 and 0.72 in 2018). Given that correlation, it would be possible to broaden these results to the wider region by estimating GPP with satellite data.","[Menefee, Dorothy; Rajan, Nithya; Bagavathiannan, Muthukumar; Schnell, Ronnie] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Soil & Crop Sci, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Cui, Song] Middle Tennessee State Univ, Sch Agr, Murfreesboro, TN 37130 USA; [West, Jason] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Ecosyst Sci & Management, College Stn, TX USA",,"Schnell, Ronnie/0000-0001-6174-9953; West, Jason/0000-0002-7811-8020",National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) [2016-70001-24636]; Cotton Incorporated [17-614]; Planet's Education and Research Program,National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA); Cotton Incorporated(Cotton R&D Corp); Planet's Education and Research Program,"This project was supported by grants from the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) (Grant 2016-70001-24636) and Cotton Incorporated (Grant 17-614).

Although significant efforts have been made in modeling the carbon cycle dynamics over this area, large uncertainty still exists in the previous simulations in terms of reproducing individual components of the carbon cycle and their responses to environmental variability. Here we evaluated the performance of an advanced agroecosystem model, ecosys, in simulating carbon budgets over the U.S. Midwest, considering both the magnitude of carbon flux/yield and its response to environmental (climate and soil) variability. We conducted model simulations and evaluations at 7 cropland eddy-covariance sites as well as over 293 counties of Illinois, Indiana, and Iowa in the U.S. Midwest. The site-level simulations showed that ecosys captured both the magnitude and seasonal patterns of carbon fluxes (i.e., net ecosystem carbon exchange (NEE), ecosystem gross primary production (GPP), and ecosystem respiration (Reco)), leaf area index (LAI), and dynamic plant carbon allocation processes, with R-2 equal to 0.92, 0.87, 0.87, and 0.78 for GPP, NEE, Reco, and LAI, respectively across all the sites compared with the observations. For regional scale simulations, ecosys reproduced the spatial distribution and interannual variability of corn and soybean yields with the constraints of observed yields and a new remotely sensed GPP product, with R2 of multi-year averaged simulated and observed yield equal 0.83 and 0.80 for corn and soybean, respectively. The simulated responses of carbon cycle dynamics to environmental variability were consistent with that from the empirical observations at both site and regional scales. Our results demonstrated the applicability of ecosys in simulating the carbon cycle and soil carbon dynamics of the U.S. Midwestern agroecosystems under different climate and soil conditions.","[Zhou, Wang; Guan, Kaiyu; Peng, Bin; Jiang, Chongya] Univ Illinois, Agroecosyst Sustainabil Ctr, Inst Sustainabil Energy & Environm, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Zhou, Wang; Guan, Kaiyu; Peng, Bin; Jiang, Chongya] Univ Illinois, Coll Agr Consumer & Environm Sci, Dept Nat Resources & Environm Sci, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Guan, Kaiyu; Peng, Bin] Univ Illinois, Natl Ctr Supercomp Applicat, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Tang, Jinyun] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Earth & Environm Sci Area, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Jin, Zhenong] Univ Minnesota, Dept Bioprod & Biosyst Engn, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Grant, Robert; Mezbahuddin, Symon] Univ Alberta, Dept Renewable Resources, Edmonton, AB T6G2E3, Canada; [Mezbahuddin, Symon] Alberta Agr & Forestry, Nat Resource Management Branch, Edmonton, AB, Canada",,,National Science Foundation (NSF) Career Award [1847334]; Foundation for Food and Agriculture Research (FFAR) [602757]; DOE Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E) SMARTFARM program [DE-FOA-0002250]; NASA Carbon Monitoring System Program [80NSSC18K0170]; USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) Program [2017-67013-26253]; Department of Energy (DOE) [25-1215-0208-006],National Science Foundation (NSF) Career Award(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Office of the Director (OD)); Foundation for Food and Agriculture Research (FFAR); DOE Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E) SMARTFARM program(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); NASA Carbon Monitoring System Program; USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) Program; Department of Energy (DOE)(United States Department of Energy (DOE)),"Authors acknowledge the support from the National Science Foundation (NSF) Career Award (1847334), the Foundation for Food and Agriculture Research (FFAR) (Grant ID: 602757), DOE Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E) SMARTFARM program (DEFOA-0002250), NASA Carbon Monitoring System Program (80NSSC18K0170), USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) Program (2017-67013-26253 and Hatch), and Department of Energy (DOE) (25-1215-0208-006).

However, the performances of various GPP models in agroecosystems have been rarely explored. In this study, we calibrated the model parameters and compared the performances of seven light use efficiency (LUE-GPP) models and five vegetation-index (VI-GPP) models for simulating daily GPP of agro-ecosystems over 106 crop growing seasons, and examined the effects of model structure on model performance. The simulations were carried out based on 19 eddy covariance (EC) sites from the global flux network and vegetation indices obtained from MoDIS. The calibrated potential LUE (epsilon(max)) for C-4 crop (summer maize, 2.59 +/- 0.94 g C MJ(-1)) was higher than that for C-3 crops (1.42 +/- 0.58 g C MJ(-)(1)) in any LUE-GPP models. The performances of models differed across the crops. Generally, all models performed better for C-3 crops than C-4 crops, and for winter crops (winter wheat Triticion aestivum L, rape-Bra.ssira napes L, and winter barley-llardeurn vulgare L) than summer crops (summer make-Zea mays L, potato :Solarium tuberosum L, rice-Otyza saliva L. and soybean-Glycine max (L.) Merr.). Cloudiness index-LUE (CI-LUE) model outperformed the other LUE-GPP models, and vegetation index (VEI) model outperformed the other VI-GPP models. LUE-GPP models demonstrated better performance than VI-GPP models due to the inclusion of water stress (W-s) and temperature stress (T-s). A comparison of the model structures showed that models only considering the effects of W-s produced smaller errors than those only considering the effects of T-s in simulating GPP. W-s algorithms generated the larger variations in LUE-GPP models compared to those of T-s especially during the drought period. All models obtained higher R-2 and smaller errors using the minimum method (Min (T-s, W-s)) than using the multiplication method (T-s x W-s) to integrate the effects of T-s and W-s on GPP, which suggested that the minimum method was better than the multiplication method to integrate T-s and W, on LUE. These results showed that satellite-based models with calibrated crop-specific parameters have the potential to serve as the basis for estimation of agroecosystem GPP, and can provide direction for future model structure optimization.","[Jiang, Shouzheng; Zhao, Lu; Liang, Chuan; Cui, Ningbo; Zou, Qingyao] Sichuan Univ, State Key Lab Hydraul & Mt River Engn, Chengdu, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Shouzheng; Zhao, Lu; Liang, Chuan; Cui, Ningbo; Zou, Qingyao] Sichuan Univ, Coll Water Resource & Hydropower, Chengdu 610065, Peoples R China; [Cui, Ningbo; Hu, Xiaotao] Northwest A&F Univ, Key Lab Agr Soil & Water Engn Arid & Semiarid Are, Minist Educ, Yangling, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Gong, Daozhi; Wang, Yaosheng] Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Inst Environm & Sustainable Dev Agr, State Engn Lab Efficient Water Use Crops & Disast, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Feng, Yu] Southern Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Environm Sci & Engn, Shenzhen, Peoples R China",,"Wang, Yaosheng/0000-0002-2657-7057","National Natural Science Foundation of China [51922072, 51779161, 51009101]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2016C DDY-504-SCU, 2017CDLZ-N22, 2018CDPZH-10]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities),"We would like to thank the FLUXNET community including AmeriFlux, AsiaFlux and European Fluxes Database, and all scientists and technicians maintaining the flux site management and providing crop information.

Carbon sequestration by terrestrial plants is a key factor to a comprehensive understanding of the carbon budget at global scale. In this context, accurate measurements and estimates of GPP will allow us to achieve improved carbon monitoring and to quantitatively assess impacts from climate changes and human activities. Spacebome remote sensing observations can provide a variety of land surface parameterizations for modeling photosynthetic activities at various spatial and temporal scales. This study utilizes a simple GPP model based on LUE concept and different land surface parameterizations to evaluate the model and monitor GPP. Two maize-soybean rotation fields in Nebraska, USA and the Bartlett Experimental Forest in New Hampshire, USA were selected for study. Tower-based eddy-covariance carbon exchange and PAR measurements were collected from the FLUXNET Synthesis Dataset. For the model parameterization, we utilized different values of LUE and the fPAR derived from various algorithms. We adapted the approach and parameters from the MODIS MOD17 Biome Properties Look-Up Table (BPLUT) to derive LUE. We also used a site-specific analytic approach with tower-based Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE) and PAR to estimate maximum potential LUE (LUEmax.) to derive LUE. For the fPAR parameter, the MODIS MOD 15A2 fPAR product was used. We also utilized fAPAR(chl), a parameter accounting for the fAPAR linked to the chlorophyll-containing canopy fraction. fAPAR(chl) was obtained by inversion of a radiative transfer model, which used the MODIS-based reflectances in bands 1-7 produced by Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) algorithm. fAPAR(chl) exhibited seasonal dynamics more similar with the flux tower based GPP than MOD15A2 fPAR, especially in the spring and fall at the agricultural sites. When using the MODIS MOD17-based parameters to estimate LUE, fAPAR(chl) generated better agreements with GPP (r(2) = 0.79-0.91) than MOD15A2 fPAR (r(2) = 0.57-0.84). However, underestimations of GPP were also observed, especially for the crop fields. When applying the site-specific LUEmax value to estimate in situ LUE, the magnitude of estimated GPP was closer to in situ GPP; this method produced a slight overestimation for the MOD15A2 fPAR at the Bartlett forest. This study highlights the importance of accurate land surface parameterizations to achieve reliable carbon monitoring capabilities from remote sensing information. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Hydrological and carbon processes in agricultural ecosystem models are complex due to interactions between parameters. It is therefore crucial to identify parameter sensitivity before a process-based model is applied for simulations and predictions of water, energy and carbon fluxes in agricultural ecosystems. In this study, we investigated the sensitivity and equifinality of the CoupModel parameters in modeling an arid agricultural ecosystem in northwestern China. In total, 27 model parameters were analyzed using a global parameters sensitivity analysis approach and a combination of multiple in situ and remotely sensed data sets. Among the five major model processes, we found that the energy balance process account for much of the importance in the model, followed by soil hydrology, plant growth, soil heat, and soil carbon processes. Meanwhile, parameters from the plant growth process exhibited higher equifinalities than other processes. We found that net ecosystem exchange (NEE) is controlled by soil heat, soil hydrology and energy balance processes, which is mainly due to a high equifinality (0.91) between the parameters g(max) (maximal stomatal conductance) and V-cmax (maximal carboxylation rate). The equifinalities between different parameters result in a trade-off in model performance metrics (i.e. determination coefficient R-2 and mean error ME) in the water, energy and carbon balance simulations. We revealed that daytime and yearly accumulated eddy fluxes (sensible heat H-s, latent heat LE and NEE) can constrain the model parameters better. Remotely sensed data were also promising as additional constraints on soil water contents and energy fluxes. This study introduced a systematic global parameter sensitivity analysis approach together with the equifinality identification in an ecosystem model. The approach proposed here is applicable to other studies and the equifinalities detected in this study can be important implications for modelling arid agricultural ecosystems. Additional exploration on remotely sensed data in constraining the model from different aspects are highly recommended in modeling agricultural ecosystems.","[Wu, Mousong] Nanjing Univ, Sch Geog & Ocean Sci, Int Inst Earth Syst Sci ESSI, Nanjing 210023, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Wu, Mousong; Zhang, Wenxin] Lund Univ, Dept Phys Geog & Ecosyst Sci, SE-22362 Lund, Sweden; [Ran, Youhua] Chinese Acad Sci, Cold & Arid Reg Environm & Engn Res Inst, Heihe Remote Sensing Expt Res Stn, Key Lab Remote Sensing Gansu Prov, Lanzhou, Gansu, Peoples R China; [Jansson, Per-Erik] KTH Royal Inst Technol, Dept Sustainable Dev Environm Sci & Engn, Stockholm, Sweden; [Chen, Peng] Hohai, State Key Lab Hydrol Water Resources & Hydraul En, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Chen, Peng] Joint Int Res Lab Global Change & Water Cycle, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Chen, Peng] Hohai Univ, Coll Hydrol & Water Resources, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Tan, Xiao] Sichuan Univ, Coll Water Resource & Hydropower, State Key Lab Hydraul & Mt River Engn, Chengdu 610065, Sichuan, Peoples R China",,"Ran, Youhua/0000-0001-7774-4612; Jansson, Per-Erik/0000-0002-9727-4037; Wu, Mousong/0000-0003-1141-3022; Zhang, Wenxin/0000-0001-9477-563X","National Key Research and Development Program of China [2016YFA0600204, 2017YFC0403304]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41471359]; Youth Innovation Promotion Association of Chinese Academy of Sciences [2016375]; Opening Research Foundation of the State Key Laboratory of Water Resources and Hydropower Engineering Science, Wuhan University [2017NSG02]","National Key Research and Development Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Youth Innovation Promotion Association of Chinese Academy of Sciences; Opening Research Foundation of the State Key Laboratory of Water Resources and Hydropower Engineering Science, Wuhan University","This study was jointly supported by National Key Research and Development Program of China (2016YFA0600204, 2017YFC0403304), National Natural Science Foundation of China projects (41471359), and the Youth Innovation Promotion Association of Chinese Academy of Sciences (Grant number: 2016375).

Agroecosystem models are generally used to assess cropland carbon fluxes because of their ability to capture the complex interactive effects of factors influencing carbon balance. For regional carbon flux simulations, generally gridded climate data sets are used because they offer data for each grid cell of the region of interest. However, studies consistently report uncertainties in climate datasets, which affect the accuracy of carbon flux simulations. OBJECTIVE: The objectives were to 1) determine the uncertainties in daily weather variables of commonly used high resolution gridded climate datasets in the U.S (NARR, NLDAS, Prism and Daymet); 2) estimate their impact on the accuracy of simulated Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE) under irrigated and non-irrigated corn and soybeans using the Environmental Policy Integrated Climate (EPIC) agroecosystem model, and 3) understand the relative sensitivity of the NEE to various climate variables. METHODS: The observational data at four flux tower cropland sites in the U.S Midwest region were used to quantify the uncertainties in the gridded weather datasets, and EPIC simulations were performed at each flux tower site using each gridded climate dataset. Further, sensitivity analysis using Extended Fourier Amplitude Sensitivity Test (EFAST) was conducted. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that daily weather variables in all gridded climate datasets display some degree of bias, leading to considerable uncertainty in simulated NEE. The gridded climate datasets produced based on interpolation techniques (i.e. Daymet and Prism) were shown to have less uncertainties, and resulted in NEE estimates with relatively higher accuracy, likely due to their higher spatial resolution and higher dependency on meteorological station observations. The Mean Absolute Percentage Errors (MAPE) values of average growing season NEE estimates for Dayment, Prism, NLDAS and NARR include 22.53%, 23.45%, 62.52% and 66.18%, respectively. The NEE under irrigation (MAPE = 53.15%) tends to be more sensitive to uncertainties compared to the fluxes under non-irrigation (MAPE = 34.19%). Further, this study highlights that NEE responds differently to the individual climate variables and management. Under irrigation management, NEE are more sensitive to temperature. Conversely, under non-irrigation, precipitation is the most dominant factor influencing NEE uncertainty. SIGNIFICANCE: These findings demonstrate that careful consideration is necessary when selecting climate data to mitigate uncertainties in simulated NEE. Further, alternative approaches such as integration of remote sensing data products may help reduce the models' dependency on climate datasets and improve the accuracy in the simulated CO2 fluxes.","[Bandaru, Varaprasad] Univ Maryland, Dept Geog Sci, College Pk, MD 20742 USA",,,NASA Carbon Monitoring System program [80NSSC21K0968],NASA Carbon Monitoring System program,"This work is partly supported by NASA Carbon Monitoring System program (grant no: 80NSSC21K0968).

On agricultural land, annual herbaceous vegetation is not considered a carbon sink, whereas perennial woody vegetation accumulates biomass over multiple years and does represent a carbon sink. This paper presents a study to estimate aboveground woody carbon stock in 1990 and its annual change from 1990 to 2000 on Canada's cropland. The cropland was stratified into zones according to soils, climate and cropping systems, within which sample plots were randomly selected and paired aerial photographs corresponding to circa 1990 and 2000 were interpreted to detect changes in perennial woody vegetation such as trees, shrubs, orchards and vineyards. Woody biomass volumes lost as a result of land use change and gained as a result of planting and growth were estimated using species composition and growth rates typical of each zone, as obtained from published literature, forest reports and charts and forestry expert knowledge. Census of agriculture data was used to scale up the sample level results to zone and national levels. Results showed that on Canada's cropland, the aboveground woody carbon stock in 1990 was 33.7 +/- 8.8 Tg. Between 1990 and 2000, the area covered by woody vegetation was affected negatively by removals and positively through planting and natural regeneration, leading to a net reduction in area. There was an annual increase of about 78.3 Gg over all cropland in Canada, with a net decrease in some ecozones. Although this is a comparatively small increase with a large uncertainty, it indicates that changes in woody carbon on cropland in Canada over the 1990-2000 period were relatively insignificant. Further studies may be needed to refine the carbon estimates and reduce uncertainties. Crown Copyright (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Therefore, reliable estimations of carbon sequestration and emission at the landscape level after land cover transition from forest, swidden agriculture and other land use types are needed. We reviewed studies on C stocks and dynamics in rubber plantations considering the contribution of aboveground and belowground biomass, soil organic matter, collected latex and other minor components. C sequestration occurred after conversion of arable land to rubber plantations while C losses usually prevailed if forest was converted to rubber. These general trends strongly depended on local climate conditions and soil properties as well as on topography. Non-traditional planting of rubber under subtropical conditions with a dryer climate and at high elevations (300-1000 m above sea level) decreased the C sequestration potential of rubber. We show how rotation length, rubber clone, and management strategies like tapping frequency or planting density affect C stocks, discuss the uncertainties in C stock estimation and highlight improved approaches. An important conclusion is that upscaling of C stocks and dynamics under different climate scenarios and rotation lengths to a regional level requires the use of time averaged C stocks. Enhanced remote sensing techniques can greatly improve C stock estimates at the regional level, allowing for an accounting of the variability caused by terrain and plantation properties. A partial life cycle assessment of rubber production revealed greenhouse gas emissions as a minor contribution when compared to land use change effects on plant and soil C stocks and C accumulation in latex, wood products and seed oil. The review highlights scantily explored topics and proposes directions for future studies, which should decrease uncertainties in C estimates in rubber dominated landscapes. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

C dynamics has been identified as a key intermediate or support ecosystem service that is profoundly altered by agricultural practices. The temperate grasslands of Argentina, the Pampas, are one of the main crop production regions of the world. Crop sequence, tillage and fertilization change inputs and outputs and, consequently the whole C dynamics. Our objectives in this article were (i) to provide a spatially explicit characterization, based on remotely sensed data, of crop sequences and tillage systems in the Rolling Pampas, (ii) to evaluate changes in C gains by computing the absorbed photosynthetic active radiation (APAR) from NDVI data of different crop, (iii) to evaluate the soil organic carbon (SOC) balance of different management schemes (crop sequence, conventional tillage vs. no till and three levels of nitrogen fertilization) using the CENTURY model, and (iv) to estimate the changes in SOC at a regional level. The results showed that 54% of the area was under continuous agriculture, with only two crop rotations occupying 61% of the area, and the main tillage system was no-tillage (73% of the area analyzed). Annual APAR was lower in crops than in rangelands, except for wheat-soybean double crop. Based on CENTURY simulations the crop management which had a most negative SOC balance (SOC reference value (100%) = 79 t ha(-1)) was crop sequence maize/soybean under conventional tillage and with no fertilizer application (37% losses of SOC in 60 years). The management that presented the most positive SOC balance was soybean/wheat-soybean double crop (6 years) pasture (4 years) under no till and with high fertilization (10% increase of SOC in 60 years). A positive and linear relationship was found between APAR estimates derived from satellite data and simulated SOC providing basis for a quantitative hypothesis on the importance of C inputs on SOC's dynamics. At regional scale, if crop sequences proportions remain constant, the lost of SOC would average a 15% in 60 years. (C) 2011 Elsevier BM.

The papers offered new frameworks to studying agricultural land use across multiple scales in a way that captured causality from interacting components of the system. Each paper argued for more comprehensive data sets; foreseeing the power of network-based science, the potential of molecular technologies to assess biodiversity, and advances in remote sensing.

The formulation and implementation of policies to achieve such reductions requires an understanding of current and historic land-use change and associated greenhouse gas emissions. In addition, it is often proposed that any reduction in emissions be measured against a reference scenario that describes future land-use in the absence of intervention. However, the information needed to progress this agenda is rarely available, as robust data on the extent and causes of land-use change, and the associated changes in carbon stocks, are sparse, particularly in African woodlands. Here we present a novel method for obtaining such information by combining data from radar remote sensing and ground surveys with a simple aspatial model. Using this approach we quantify changes in woody biomass and investigate the land-use activities that caused these changes in a 7500km2 area of Manica province, Mozambique. We use the data to construct a model linking the activities causing biomass loss to hypothesised drivers, allowing the definition of future scenarios. Within the study area, biomass was lost at a rate of 2.8¬±1.9% per year, with stocks changing from 19.4¬±0.9TgC in 2007 to 17.6¬±0.9TgC in 2010. Small-scale agriculture was the direct cause of 46¬±17% of the total biomass loss, followed in magnitude by construction and miscellaneous activities (24¬±11%), charcoal production (18¬±9%), logging (9¬±5%) and commercial agriculture (3¬±2%). Uncertainties remain on the biomass accumulated by regrowing vegetation. Extrapolating into the future, a scenario that includes projected population growth shows 41% of biomass being lost from 2010 to 2020 (a loss of 7.2TgC). A scenario of intensive policy interventions gives reduced losses of 3.8TgC by factoring in improvements in crop yields, charcoal production efficiency, and sustainable timber harvesting. Our case study demonstrates the importance of low intensity losses of biomass in African woodlands, and highlights the broad range of activities that will need to be addressed to develop locally appropriate mitigation actions. The simple modelling framework allows for the transparent creation of scenarios in data sparse areas, which could be used as local or national reference emissions levels under REDD+. ¬© 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2014,53,,,10.1016/j.apgeog.2014.05.014,,,,23100820000;24479775800;55880370600;,,45.0,54.0,,45.0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84902983237&doi=10.1016%2fj.apgeog.2014.05.014&partnerID=40&md5=476ad9cbb45ff03b2f0afb8e5b42f228,biomass; charcoal; deforestation; emission control; logging (timber); population growth; radar; remote sensing; timber harvesting; Manica; Mozambique,English,Final,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84902983237,,,,Q1

Land management practices play a major role in determining global yield variability, and add an anthropogenic signal to the observed seasonality of atmospheric CO2 concentrations. However, there is still little knowledge on spatial and temporal variability of important farmland activities such as crop sowing dates, and thus these remain rather crudely approximated within carbon cycle studies. In this study, we present a framework allowing for spatiotemporally resolved simulation of cropland carbon fluxes under observational constraints on land management and canopy greenness. We apply data assimilation methodology in order to explicitly account for information on sowing dates and model leaf area index. MODIS 250m vegetation index data were assimilated both in batch-calibration for sowing date estimation and sequentially for improved model state estimation, using the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF), into a crop carbon mass balance model (SPAc). In doing so, we are able to quantify the multiannual (2000-2006) regional carbon flux and biometry seasonality of maize-soybean crop rotations surrounding the Bondville Ameriflux eddy covariance site, averaged over 104 pixel locations within the wider area. (1) Validation at the Bondville site shows that growing season C cycling is simulated accurately with MODIS-derived sowing dates, and we expect that this framework allows for accurate simulations of C cycling at locations for which ground-truth data are not available. Thus, this framework enables modellers to simulate current (i.e. last 10 yr) carbon cycling of major agricultural regions. Averaged over the 104 field patches analysed, relative spatial variability for biometry and net ecosystem exchange ranges from similar to 7% to similar to 18 %. The annual sign of net biome productivity is not significantly different from carbon neutrality. (2) Moreover, observing carbon cycling at one single field with its individual sowing pattern is not sufficient to constrain large-scale agroecosystem carbon flux seasonality. Study area average growing season length is 20 days longer than observed at Bondville, primarily because of an earlier estimated start of season. (3) For carbon budgeting, additional information on cropland soil management and belowground carbon cycling has to be considered, as such constraints are not provided by MODIS.","[Sus, O.; Williams, M.] Univ Edinburgh, Sch GeoSci, Edinburgh EH9 3JN, Midlothian, Scotland; [Sus, O.; Williams, M.] Univ Edinburgh, SAGES, Edinburgh EH9 3JN, Midlothian, Scotland; [Heuer, M.

Generally, the most commonly used covariates (MCC; e.g., topographic attributes and single-time remote sensing data, and legacy maps) were employed in DSM studies. Additionally, remote sensing time-series (RST) data can provide useful information for soil mapping. Therefore, the main aims of the study are to compare the MCC, the monthly Sentinel-2 time-series of vegetation indices dataset, and the combination of datasets (MCC + RST) for soil organic carbon (SOC) prediction in an arid agroecosystem in Iran. We used different machine learning algorithms, including random forest (RF), Cubist, support vector machine (SVM), and partial least square regression (PLSR). A total of 237 soil samples at 0-20 cm depths were collected. The 5-fold cross-validation technique was used to evaluate the modeling performance, and 50 bootstrap models were applied to quantify the prediction uncertainty. The results showed that the Cubist model performed the best with the MCC dataset (R-2 = 0.35, RMSE = 0.26%) and the combined dataset of MCC and RST (R-2 = 0.33, RMSE = 0.27%), while the RF model showed better results for the RST dataset (R-2 = 0.10, RMSE = 0.31%). Soil properties could explain the SOC variation in MCC and combined datasets (66.35% and 50.82%, respectively), while NDVI was the most controlling factor in the RST (50.22%). Accordingly, results showed that time-series vegetation indices did not have enough potential to increase SOC prediction accuracy. However, the combination of MCC and RST datasets produced SOC spatial maps with lower uncertainty. Therefore, future studies are required to explicitly explain the efficiency of time-series remotely-sensed data and their interrelationship with environmental covariates to predict SOC in arid regions with low SOC content.","[Zeraatpisheh, Mojtaba; Xu, Ming] Henan Univ, Henan Key Lab Earth Syst Observat & Modeling, Kaifeng 475004, Peoples R China; [Zeraatpisheh, Mojtaba; Xu, Ming] Henan Univ, Coll Geog & Environm Sci, Kaifeng 475004, Peoples R China; [Garosi, Younes; Ayoubi, Shamsollah] Isfahan Univ Technol, Coll Agr, Dept Soil Sci, Esfahan 8415683111, Iran; [Owliaie, Hamid Reza] Univ Yasuj, Coll Agr, Yasuj, Iran; [Taghizadeh-Mehrjardi, Ruhollah; Scholten, Thomas] Univ Tubingen, Dept Geosci Soil Sci & Geomorphol, D-72070 Tubingen, Germany; [Taghizadeh-Mehrjardi, Ruhollah; Scholten, Thomas] Univ Tubingen, SFB 1070 ResourceCultures, Gartenstr 29, D-72074 Tubingen, Germany; [Taghizadeh-Mehrjardi, Ruhollah; Scholten, Thomas] Univ Tubingen, DFG Cluster Excellence Machine Learning, Tubingen, Germany",,"Zeraatpisheh, Mojtaba/0000-0001-7209-0744; Taghizadeh, Ruhollah/0000-0002-4620-6624","National Key Research and Development Program of China [2017YFA0604302, 2018YFA0606500]; Isfahan University of Technology; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) under Germany's Excellence Strategy -EXC [2064/1, 390727645, SFB 1070, 215859406]","National Key Research and Development Program of China; Isfahan University of Technology; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) under Germany's Excellence Strategy -EXC(German Research Foundation (DFG))","Mojtaba Zeraatpisheh's postdoctoral program at Henan University, China, has been supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China, grant numbers 2017YFA0604302 and 2018YFA0606500.

This study aimed to predict the spatial distribution of soil fractions (i.e. percentages of sand, silt, and clay) in Sistan floodplain on a regional scale (area: 1500 km(2)). Random forest (RF), regression kriging-neural network residual kriging (RKNNRK), neural network residual kriging (NNRK), regression kriging (RK), and cokriging (COK) methods were used to map soil texture components over the region. Soil fractions were measured for 160 soil samples taken from the surface layer (0-30 cm) of various soil series in agriculture land of Sistan floodplain. The additive log-ratio (air) transformation was applied to transform texture components prior to prediction. Remote sensing data including Landsat 8' Bands (1-8), Band 4 to Band 8 ratio, Band 4 to Band 3 ratio, NDVI, GSI, Brightness Index, and Clay Index were used as auxiliary variables for interpolation of soil fractions. 80% of actual data was used for prediction and 20% of data was used for validation. The performance of methods used was evaluated using RMSE, ME and MAE criteria. The results showed that the RKNNRK model has the highest accuracy for prediction of sand (RMSE = 15.04%) and clay (RMSE = 8.77%) contents while the most accurate model for predicting silt content is NNRK (RMSE = 12.68%). RK and COK performed worse than NNRK and RKNNRK. A relatively high value of RMSE obtained for sand (17.89%), silt (14.15%), and clay (8.89%) contents by the RF model. This could be due to the low relief of study area, regional scale effects, low density of sampling points and high heterogeneity of soil texture components in floodplains. Our findings revealed that RKNNRK and NNRK models, when combined with remote sensing data, produce more accurate results and therefore can be used for appropriate mapping of soil fractions in floodplains and on a regional scale.","[Shahriari, Mohammad; Delbari, Masoomeh; Afrasiab, Peyman] Univ Zabol, Fac Water & Soil, Dept Water Engn, Zabol, Iran; [Pahlavan-Rad, Mohammad Reza] AREEO, Sistan Agr & Nat Resources Res & Educ Ctr, Soil & Water Res Departmem, Zabol, Iran; [Pahlavan-Rad, Mohammad Reza] AREEO, Golestan Agr & Nat Resources Res & Educ Ctr, Soil & Water Res Departmem, Gorgon, Iran",,"Rad, Mohammad Reza Pahlavan/0000-0001-7821-8585; Delbari, Masoomeh/0000-0002-9902-9633; Shahriari, Mohammadreza/0000-0002-7519-3172",,,,,79.0,15.0,16.0,ELSEVIER,0341-8162,1872-6887,,CATENA,Catena,NOV,2019,182,,104149,10.1016/j.catena.2019.104149,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2019.104149,,12.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Q1

Carbon storage in ecosystems in China has been estimated using inventory and modeling methods in the past two decades. However, different methods may result in varied magnitudes and forms of carbon storage. In this study, the current status of carbon storage in terrestrial ecosystems in China, including the impacts of land use, is summarized in the national, regional, and biome scales. Significant differences in data have existed among studies. Such differences are mainly attributed to variations in estimation methods, data availability, and periods. According to available national-scale information on Chinese terrestrial ecosystems, vegetation carbon in China is 6.1 Pg C to 76.2 Pg C (mean 36.98 Pg C) and soil carbon is 43.6 Pg C to 185.7 Pg C (mean 100.75 Pg C). The forest sector has vegetation carbon of 3.26 Pg C to 9.11 Pg C (mean 5.49 Pg C), whereas the grassland sector has 0.13 Pg C to 3.06 Pg C (mean 1.41 Pg C). Soil carbon in the forest and grassland sectors exhibits more significant regional variations. Further studies need a comprehensive methodology, which combines national inventory, field measurement, eddy covariance technique, remote sensing, and model simulation in a single framework, as well as all available data at different temporal and spatial scales, to fully account for the carbon budget in China.","Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geochem, State Key Lab Environm Geochem, Guiyang 550002, Guizhou Provinc, Peoples R China",,"Ni, Jian/0000-0001-5411-7050",National Basic Research Program of China [2013CB956704]; Hundred Talents Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences,National Basic Research Program of China(National Basic Research Program of China); Hundred Talents Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences),This research was funded by the National Basic Research Program of China (2013CB956704) and the Hundred Talents Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.

Once the surface vegetation degenerates, it may not be restored. This requires the development of soil organic matter (SOM) monitoring method without destroying the surface, so as to ensure the sustainable development of plateau agriculture. This work investigated the environmental factors that are significantly related to SOM content in the river valley of the southern QTP. These environmental factors include soil hydrothermal factors (soil moisture content and soil temperature), topographic factors (elevation and slope) and vegetation factor (NDVI). The original band reflectivity (OR) of Landsat 8 OLI images and the band reflectivity after the first-order derivative (FDR) and the second-order derivative (SDR) processing were combined with the above environmental factors to estimate SOM content. The results showed that the accuracy of the model was improved obviously by adding environmental factors. The estimation effect of back propagation neural network (BPNN) model was better than that of geographically weighted regression (GWR) model, partial least squares regression (PLSR) model and multivariable linear regression (MLR) model. GWR model can also meet the estimation requirements, while PLSR and MLR models cannot achieve effectively the estimation of SOM content. FDR-BPNN model considering environmental factors was the best model for estimating SOM content, with R2 being 0.947, RMSEC being 4.701 g.kg- 1 and MAEV being 5.485 g.kg 1. Moreover, the model had the lowest uncertainty and the highest stability. This study will provide a good insight for the monitoring of SOM content in the future, and provide basic data support for the implementation of precision agriculture in the QTP.","[Yu, Qing; Yao, Tianci; Lu, Hongwei; Feng, Wei; Xue, Yuxuan; Liu, Binxiao] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Water Cycle & Related Land Surface Proc, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Yu, Qing; Yao, Tianci; Feng, Wei; Xue, Yuxuan; Liu, Binxiao] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China",,,Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDA20040301]; Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research Program (STEP) [2019QZKK1003]; National Key Research and Development Program of China [2019YFC0507801],Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences); Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research Program (STEP); National Key Research and Development Program of China,"This research was supported by the Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [Grant No. XDA20040301], the Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research Program (STEP) [Grant No. 2019QZKK1003] and the National Key Research and Development Program of China [Grant No.2019YFC0507801].",,44.0,4.0,4.0,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,0168-1699,1872-7107,,COMPUT ELECTRON AGR,Comput.

This research aimed at evaluating ML algorithms to predict spatial distribution of soil biological properties and wheat yield in the Southwest of Iran. Topsoil samples (0‚Äì30 cm) were collected from a total of 60 sampling locations and wheat grain yield (plot 1 √ó 1 m) was recorded at each location. Soil properties including urease (Ur), alkaline phosphatase (AP), basal respiration (BR), microbial biomass carbon (MBC), soil organic carbon (SOC), MBC:SOC ratio, and metabolic quotient (qCO2) were measured. At the first step, Random Forest (RF) model was employed to predict soil biological properties by using terrain attributes, remote sensing indices and soil properties as covariates. In this step, both Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) and Pearson regression were applied to select the most important covariates in predicting soil biological properties and to decrease the dimension of the input space with considering no reduction in prediction accuracy. Secondly, wheat grain yield was modeled using six ML algorithms; they were optimized and evaluated in Caret package with 10-fold cross validation. Results showed the highest prediction accuracy for qCO2 (R2adj = 0.80) and the lowest for BR (R2adj = 0.23). Compared to environmental predictors, soil covariates had a greater effect in modeling Ur, qCO2, MBC and MBC:SOC ratio, while, for AP and BR, bands 6 and Chanel Network Base Level were the most important factors, respectively. In prediction of wheat grain yield, both Stochastic Gradient Boosting (SGB) and RF models outperformed with R2adj of 0.89 and 0.88, respectively. Results indicated that the Ur and AP played the major roles in predicting wheat grain yield and explaining its spatial variability. Our modeling results suggested that soil biological properties and yield can be estimated easily with reasonable accuracy. Overall, their high resolution maps may be useful for decision makers, stakeholders and applicants in agricultural management practices towards precision agriculture. ¬© 2022 Elsevier B.V.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2022,197,,,10.1016/j.compag.2022.106978,,,,57667528600;57668851500;57220617561;54684026000;57197816204;24923039700;57072785600;,106978,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85129539795&doi=10.1016%2fj.compag.2022.106978&partnerID=40&md5=a26bd745e7cd8a88bb8a6c66cad162ef,Adaptive boosting; Alkalinity; Crops; Cultivation; Decision trees; E-learning; Forecasting; Grain (agricultural product); Mapping; Organic carbon; Phosphatases; Remote sensing; Soil surveys; Soils; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Covariates; Environmental covariate; Grain yield; Machine learning algorithms; Microbial biomass carbon; Soil biological properties; Soil property; Spatial modelling; Wheat grains; Yield; Machine learning; agricultural management; crop yield; digital mapping; digital terrain model; machine learning; organic carbon; phosphatase; remote sensing; respiration; sampling; spatial distribution; wheat; Iran,English,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85129539795,,,,Q1

In this study, we combined AGB field survey data and remote sensing data to build a suitable model to estimate the grassland AGB in the Three-River Source Region (TRSR) of China. Three machine learning models were used to simulate the grassland AGB from 2001 to 2019, including support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and high accuracy surface modeling (HASM). The results show that (1) the HASM achieved better results than the RF and SVM models (R-2 = 0.8459 > 0.72 > 0.5858; RMSE = 29 < 41 < 56), and the HASM results reproduce the spatial distribution characteristics of the biomass well. The subsequent spatiotemporal analysis of the AGB conducted in this study was based on the results of the HASM. (2) The highest AGB was located in the eastern and central-southern parts of the TRSR, and the lowest AGB was distributed in the western region. (3) The overall change in the AGB revealed that the percentage of the area that experienced a significant increase in AGB (21%) was larger than that of the area that experienced a significant decrease (13%), and the stable areas accounted for 66% of the total area. The grassland AGB increased by 1 g/m(2)/yr during 2001-2019. (4) The factors driving the changes in the AGB were analyzed. Overall, the warm and wet climate conditions promoted grass growth in most regions of the TRSR. (5) However, the biomass decreased in some regions with warm and wet conditions. For example, overgrazing and increased populations of grazing led to significant biomass decreases in the towns of Ziketang and Heka in Xinghai County. In this study, the grassland AGB was simulated based on the HASM model, with a high accuracy and a spatial resolution of 500 m. The results of this study provide a scientific basis for grassland resource protection and the highly effective implementation of grassland restoration projects in China.","[Zhou, Wei] Southwest Univ, Sch Geog Sci, Chongqing 400715, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Wei; Wang, Zong; Du, Zhengping; Yue, Tianxiang] Chinese Acad Sci, State Key Lab Resources & Environm Informat Syst, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Wei; Li, Haoran; Xie, Lijuan] Chongqing Jiaotong Univ, Dept Geog & Land & Resources, Chongqing 400074, Peoples R China; [Nie, Xuemin] Qinghai Ecol Environm Monitoring Ctr, Xining 810007, Peoples R China",,,"China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2019M650821]; Scientific and Technological Research Program of the Chongqing Municipal Education Commission [KJQN201800702]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41977337, 41501575]",China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation); Scientific and Technological Research Program of the Chongqing Municipal Education Commission; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This study was supported by the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (2019M650821), the Scientific and Technological Research Program of the Chongqing Municipal Education Commission (KJQN201800702), and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41977337, 41501575).

The main causes of degradation include unsustainable logging, agriculture, invasive species, fire, fuelwood gathering, and livestock grazing. Forest degradation is widespread and has become an important consideration in global policy processes that deal with biodiversity, climate change, and forest management. There is, however, no generally recognized way to identify a degraded forest because perceptions of forest degradation vary depending on the cause, the particular goods or services of interest, and the temporal and spatial scales considered. Here, we suggest that there are types of forest degradation that produce a continuum of decline in provision of ecosystem services, from those in primary forests through various forms of managed forests to deforestation. Forest degradation must be measured against a desired baseline condition, and the types of degradation can be represented using five criteria that relate to the drivers of degradation, loss of ecosystem services and sustainable management, including: productivity, biodiversity, unusual disturbances, protective functions, and carbon storage. These criteria are not meant to be equivalent and some might be considered more important than others, depending on the local forest management objectives. We propose a minimum subset of seven indicators for the five criteria that should be assessed to determine forest degradation under a sustainable ecosystem management regime. The indicators can be remotely sensed (although improving calibration requires ground work) and aggregated from stand to management unit or landscape levels and ultimately to sub-national and national scales.","[Okabe, Kimiko] FFPRI Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan; [Bahamondez, Carlos] INFOR Valdivia, Valdivia, Chile; [Heymell, Victoria; Sabogal, Cesar] FAO Rome, Rome, Italy",,"Nasi, Robert/0000-0001-9739-3135; Nasi, Robert/0000-0001-9739-3135",United Nations FAO Forestry Department; Secretariat to the Convention on Biological Diversity; CGIAR Research Program; Global Environment Research Fund [S9],United Nations FAO Forestry Department; Secretariat to the Convention on Biological Diversity; CGIAR Research Program(CGIAR); Global Environment Research Fund,"We thank the United Nations FAO Forestry Department and especially M.

This is vital for the formation and implementation of better land use management practices. We studied LULC changes of 22-year period; addressing how these changes have affected the CS. We quantified LULC changes between1988 and 2010 using remote sensing methods and calculated CS changes using InvEST. Results showed that between 1988 and 2010, the rate of deforestation accelerated to 203.2 km(2) y(-1) and similar to 23% of forest were lost. Conversion of natural forest to rubber was responsible for 78% of this deforestation. Rubber expansion rate was 153.4 km(2) y(-1). Changes to LULC drove a temporal CS reduction 0.223 Tg C/km(2). Local stakeholders have strong economic interest in converting land to more profitable plantations. Government efforts is required to control land conversion through new policies and incentives to retain natural forest.

However, the estimation of net GHG changes from mitigation practices in agricultural wetlands is complex compared to dryland crops. Agricultural wetlands have more complicated carbon and nitrogen cycles with both above- and below-ground processes and export of carbon via vertical and horizontal movement of water through the wetland. This letter reviews current research methodologies in estimating greenhouse gas production and provides guidance on the provision of robust estimates of carbon sequestration and greenhouse gas emissions in agricultural wetlands through the use of low cost reliable and sustainable measurement, modelling and remote sensing applications. The guidance is highly applicable to, and aimed at, wetlands such as those in the tropics and sub-tropics, where complex research infrastructure may not exist, or agricultural wetlands located in remote regions, where frequent visits by monitoring scientists prove difficult. In conclusion, the proposed measurement-modelling approach provides guidance on an affordable solution for mitigation and for investigating the consequences of wetland agricultural practice on GHG production, ecological resilience and possible changes to agricultural yields, variety choice and farming practice.","[Lloyd, Colin R.] Ctr Ecol & Hydrol, Wallingford OX10 8BB, Oxon, England; [Rebelo, Lisa-Maria] Int Water Management Inst, Southeast Asia Reg Off, Viangchan, Laos; [Finlayson, C.

While land change impacts on ecosystem carbon dynamics have been the focus of numerous studies, few efforts have been based on observational data incorporating multiple ecosystem types spanning large geographic areas over long time horizons. In this study we use a variety of synoptic-scale remote sensing data to estimate the effect of LULC changes associated with urbanization, agricultural expansion and contraction, forest harvest, and wildfire on the carbon balance of terrestrial ecosystems (forest, grasslands, shrublands, and agriculture) in the conterminous United States (i.e. excluding Alaska and Hawaii) between 1973 and 2010. We estimate large net declines in the area of agriculture and forest, along with relatively small increases in grasslands and shrublands. The largest net change in any class was an estimated gain of 114 865 km2 of developed lands, an average rate of 3282 km2 yr-1. On average, US ecosystems sequestered carbon at an annual rate of 254 Tg C yr-1. In forest lands, the net sink declined by 35% over the study period, largely a result of land-use legacy, increasing disturbances, and reductions in forest area due to land use conversion. Uncertainty in LULC change data contributed to a ‚àº16% margin of error in the annual carbon sink estimate prior to 1985 (approximately ¬±40 Tg C yr-1). Improvements in LULC and disturbance mapping starting in the mid-1980s reduced this uncertainty by ‚àº50% after 1985. We conclude that changes in LULC are a critical component to understanding ecosystem carbon dynamics, and continued improvements in detection, quantification, and attribution of change have the potential to significantly reduce current uncertainties. ¬© 2018 The Author(s).

Land conversions in the form of agriculture, aquaculture and urbanization account for much of the deforestation of mangrove wetlands. However, natural processes at the transition zone between land and ocean can also rapidly change mangrove spread. In this study, we applied a robust field-based carbon inventory and new structural and temporal remote sensing techniques to quantify the magnitude and change of mangrove carbon stocks in major deltas across Africa and Asia. From 2000-2016, approximately 1.6% (12 270 ha) of the total mangrove area within these deltas disappeared, primarily through erosion and conversion to agriculture. However, the rapid expansion of mangroves in some regions during this same period resulted in new forests that were taller and more carbon-dense than the deforested areas. Because of the rapid vertical growth rates and horizontal expansion, new mangrove forests were able to offset the total carbon losses of 5 332 843 Mg C by 44%. Each hectare of new mangrove forest accounted for ‚àº84% to ‚àº160% of the aboveground carbon for each hectare of mangrove forest lost, regardless of the net change in mangrove area. Our study highlights the significance of the natural dynamics of erosion and sedimentation on carbon loss and sequestration potential for mangroves over time. Areas of naturally regenerating mangroves will have a much larger carbon sequestration potential if the rate of mangrove deforestation of taller forests is curbed. ¬© 2019 The Author(s).

To understand the contribution of understory carbon to the United States (US) carbon budget, we developed an approach that relies on field measurements of understory vegetation cover and height on US Department of Agriculture Forest Service, Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) subplots. Allometric models were developed to estimate aboveground understory carbon. A spatial model based on stand characteristics and remotely sensed data was also applied to estimate understory carbon on all FIA plots. We found that most understory carbon was comprised of woody shrub species (64%), followed by nonwoody forbs and graminoid species (35%) and seedlings (1%). The largest estimates were found in temperate or warm humid locations such as the Pacific Northwest and southeastern US, thus following the same broad trend as aboveground tree biomass. The average understory aboveground carbon density was estimated to be 0.977 Mg ha-1, for a total estimate of 272 Tg carbon across all managed forest land in the US (approximately 2% of the total aboveground live tree carbon pool). This estimate is more than twice as low as previous FIA modeled estimates that did not rely on understory measurements, suggesting that this pool may currently be overestimated in US National Greenhouse Gas reporting. ¬© 2017 The Author(s).

Identifying and addressing the causes or drivers of anthropogenic forest change is considered crucial for global climate change mitigation. Few countries however, monitor deforestation drivers in a systematic manner. National-level quantitative spatially explicit information on drivers is often lacking. This study quantifies proximate drivers of deforestation and related carbon losses in South America based on remote sensing time series in a systematic, spatially explicit manner. Deforestation areas were derived from the 2010 global remote sensing survey of the Food and Agricultural Organisation Forest Resource Assessment. To assess proximate drivers, land use following deforestation was assigned by visual interpretation of high-resolution satellite imagery. To estimate gross carbon losses from deforestation, default Tier 1 biomass levels per country and eco-zone were used. Pasture was the dominant driver of forest area (71.2%) and related carbon loss (71.6%) in South America, followed by commercial cropland (14% and 12.1% respectively). Hotspots of deforestation due to pasture occurred in Northern Argentina, Western Paraguay, and along the arc of deforestation in Brazil where they gradually moved into higher biomass forests causing additional carbon losses. Deforestation driven by commercial cropland increased in time, with hotspots occurring in Brazil (Mato Grosso State), Northern Argentina, Eastern Paraguay and Central Bolivia. Infrastructure, such as urban expansion and roads, contributed little as proximate drivers of forest area loss (1.7%). Our findings contribute to the understanding of drivers of deforestation and related carbon losses in South America, and are comparable at the national, regional and continental level. In addition, they support the development of national REDD+ interventions and forest monitoring systems, and provide valuable input for statistical analysis and modelling of underlying drivers of deforestation. ¬© 2015 IOP Publishing Ltd.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2015,10,12,,10.1088/1748-9326/10/12/124004,,,,55383198400;7102192954;7004609951;6503892829;7004003227;24167002800;6604066465;,124004,,,,133.0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84952933740&doi=10.1088%2f1748-9326%2f10%2f12%2f124004&partnerID=40&md5=55df0559f2d86a6e71ca43b665f8c41b,Agriculture; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Deforestation; Land use; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Forest carbons; Forest monitoring systems; Forest resource assessments; Global climate changes; High resolution satellite imagery; Proximate cause; REDD; South America; Forestry; anthropogenic effect; carbon emission; climate change; deforestation; land use change; remote sensing; satellite imagery; South America,English,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-84952933740,,,,Q1

However, the problem remains of how to quantify these gains. This article considers current greenhouse gas (GHG) quantification methods that can be used in a landscape scale analysis in terms of relevance to areas dominated by smallholders in developing countries. In landscape scale carbon accounting frameworks, measurements are an essential element. Sampling strategies need careful design to account for all pools/fluxes and to ensure judicious use of resources. Models can be used to scale-up measurements and fill data gaps. In recent years a number of accessible models and calculators have been developed which can be used at the landscape scale in developing country areas. Some are based on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) method and others on dynamic ecosystem models. They have been developed for a range of different purposes and therefore vary in terms of accuracy and usability. Landscape scale assessments of GHGs require a combination of ground sampling, use of data from census, remote sensing (RS) or other sources and modelling. Fitting of all of these aspects together needs to be performed carefully to minimize uncertainties and maximize the use of scarce resources. This is especially true in heterogeneous landscapes dominated by smallholders in developing countries. ¬© 2013 IOP Publishing Ltd.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2013,8,1,,10.1088/1748-9326/8/1/015019,,,,7102110982;6507479625;35273085100;37003333300;7004291420;37261656600;16174680800;6701818615;7004593987;55651256600;7202069241;35174303300;6507467467;6603759699;22133919300;7004418468;,15019,,,,19.0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84876196476&doi=10.1088%2f1748-9326%2f8%2f1%2f015019&partnerID=40&md5=1c7413abb7f72969f50b16f317c0fdbb,Climate change; Developing countries; Climate change mitigation; Greenhouse gas (GHG); Heterogeneous landscapes; Intergovernmental panel on climate changes; landscape; Landscape-scale assessments; Quantification methods; Sampling strategies; Greenhouse gases; accuracy assessment; carbon emission; carbon flux; census; climate change; developing world; ecosystem modeling; environmental legislation; farmers attitude; greenhouse gas; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; landscape; remote sensing; resource use; smallholder; uncertainty analysis,English,Final,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84876196476,,,,Q1

Especially in the tropics where forests are declining at a rapid rate, national forest monitoring systems capable of reliably estimating forest cover, forest cover change and carbon stock change are of vital importance. As a large number of tropical countries had limited capacity in the past to implement such a system, capacity building efforts are now ongoing to strengthen the technical and political skillsets necessary to implement national forest monitoring at institutional levels. This paper assesses the current status and recent changes in national forest monitoring and reporting capacities in 99 tropical countries, using the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) Forest Resources Assessment (FRA) 2015 data, complemented with FRA 2010 and FRA 2005 data. Three indicators ""Forest area change monitoring and remote sensing capacities"", ""Forest inventory capacities"" and ""Carbon pool reporting capacities"" were used to assess the countries' capacities for the years 2005, 2010 and 2015 and the change in capacities between 2005-2010 and 2010-2015. Forest area change monitoring and remote sensing capacities improved considerably between 2005 and 2015. The total tropical forest area that is monitored with good to very good forest area change monitoring and remote sensing capacities increased from 69% in 2005 to 83% in 2015. This corresponds to 1435. million. ha in 2005 and 1699. million. ha in 2015. This effect is related to more free and open remote sensing data and availability of techniques to improve forest area change monitoring. The total tropical forest area that is monitored with good to very good forest inventory capacities increased from 38% in 2005 to 66% in 2015. This corresponds to 785. million. ha in 2005 and 1350. million. ha in 2015. Carbon pool reporting capacities did not show as much improvement and the majority of countries still report at Tier 1 level. This indicates the need for greater emphasis on producing accurate emission factors at Tier 2 or Tier 3 level and improved greenhouse gases reporting. It is further shown that there was a positive adjustment in the net change in forest area where countries with lower capacities in the past had the tendency to overestimate the area of forest loss. The results emphasized the effectiveness of capacity building programmes (such as those by FAO and REDD+ readiness) but also the need for continued capacity development efforts. It is important for countries to maintain their forest monitoring system and update their inventories on a regular basis. This will further improve accuracy and reliability of data and information on forest resources and will provide countries with the necessary input to refine policies and decisions and to further improve forest management. ¬© 2015.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2015,352,,,10.1016/j.foreco.2015.06.003,,,,55103123100;56826044800;7102192954;24167002800;55340075400;23494133400;6602561743;6604066465;,,109.0,123.0,,121.0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84941050373&doi=10.1016%2fj.foreco.2015.06.003&partnerID=40&md5=68c83dc1484883777e5bbee67a4a6358,Greenhouse gases; Information management; Inventory control; Monitoring; Natural resources; Remote sensing; Tropics; Capacity building; Carbon reporting; Forest cover change; Monitoring system; REDD; Tropical forest; Forestry; carbon sink; emission inventory; environmental monitoring; Food and Agricultural Organization; forest cover; forest inventory; forest management; forest resource; greenhouse gas; monitoring system; remote sensing; tropical forest; United Nations; Forestry; Indicators; Information Retrieval; Remote Sensing; Tropical Atmospheres,English,Final,"All Open Access, Hybrid Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-84941050373,,,,Q1

Arg) is a major driving force for deforestation and forest degradation in mountainous South-East Asia. In China, the unclear distinction between natural forest and commercial plantations has permitted the expansion of rubber into protected forest areas of nature reserves. However, the impact of such land-use changes on landscape carbon balances within nature reserves has rarely been investigated. We selected the Naban River Watershed National Nature Reserve (NRWNNR) in Xishuangbanna, China as a case study area and evaluated carbon stocks using the Rapid Carbon Stock Appraisal (RaCSA) method based on tree, plot, land use and landscape assessments, integrating field sampling with remote sensing and GIS technology. Six dominant land use systems were surveyed: lowland forest (&lt;800 m above sea level), highland forest (&gt;800 m a.s.l.), lowland rubber, highland rubber, bush and grassland and agricultural crops. Land use type-specific time-averaged carbon stocks (Cta) were calculated based on total above ground biomass (AGB). Soil organic carbon (surface 30 cm) and below ground biomass were measured, but not included in Cta calculations due to large uncertainties unrelated to land use change. The Cta of lowland and highland rubber plantations were 58 Mg C ha-1 and 28 Mg C ha-1 respectively, showing larger carbon sequestration potential than nonforest land use types (agricultural crops, bush and grassland) but much lower than Cta of natural forest (156-185 Mg C ha-1). Sensitivity analysis of Cta variability showed that forest C stocks have the largest influence on landscape carbon balance. Time series analysis of land-use and land-cover maps (1989, 2007, 2012) demonstrated that during 23 years, the whole landscape of the nature reserve (26,574 ha) gained 0.644 Tg C. Despite rubber expansion, biosphere zoning strategy (i.e. experimental, buffer, core zones), and reforestation activities conducted in NRWNNR were able to enhance the carbon stocks. ¬© 2016 Elsevier B.V.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2016,372,,,10.1016/j.foreco.2016.04.009,,,,57191642822;57209001407;46861384100;57188766856;57202603298;55801955700;7003367380;,,149.0,163.0,,39.0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84962860043&doi=10.1016%2fj.foreco.2016.04.009&partnerID=40&md5=f7d9685df81f01690aa8f9ca7ba06823,Agriculture; Biospherics; Crops; Deforestation; Forestry; Geographic information systems; Organic carbon; Reforestation; Remote sensing; Rubber; Rubber plantations; Sea level; Sensitivity analysis; Time series analysis; Agricultural landscapes; Carbon sequestration; Carbon sequestration potential; Carbon stocks; Commercial plantation; Land use and land cover; Landscape assessments; Remote sensing and GIS; Land use; belowground biomass; biogeochemical cycle; carbon flux; carbon sequestration; evergreen tree; grassland; land use change; organic carbon; plantation; range expansion; reforestation; remote sensing; rubber; zoning; China; Naban River; Xishuangbanna; Yunnan; Hevea brasiliensis,English,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84962860043,,,,Q1

Rangelands cover 54% of California, representing a large stock of SOC, but existing SOC estimates are uncertain. To improve understanding of fine-resolution SOC stocks in complex terrain and provide guidance to rangeland SOC inventories, we grid-sampled 105 locations (21-m grid cells) at two depths (0-10 and 10-30 cm) in a 10-ha annual grassland catchment in California's Central Coast Range. Soils were analyzed for bulk density, coarse fragments, SOC and texture. Monthly aerial imagery was acquired by an unmanned aerial vehicle to compare surface reflectance during two contrasting years (wet vs. dry) to SOC stocks. We found that the 0-30 cm soil thickness held 3.64 +/- 0.71 kg SOC m(-2) (mean +/- SD) with a range of 1.97-5.49 kg SOC m(-2). The 0-10 cm soil thickness stored 47% of the 0-30 cm SOC stock with SOC concentrations twice as high in the 0-10 cm layer (1.40 +/- 0.38%) as in the 10-30 cm layer (0.71 +/- 0.15% SOC). Multiple linear regression (MLR) models explained 50-57% of SOC variability at 0-30 and 10-30 cm, but only 25% of variability at 0-10 cm. Based on cross-validation tests, MLR outperformed spatial interpolation methods and Random Forest models, best explaining SOC stocks with five environmental covariates: wet-year greenness, mean curvature, elevation, insolation, and slope. Lower hillslope positions, concave landforms, and enhanced wet-year greenness were associated with more SOC, and explained 11%, 24%, and 31% of variability in 0-30 cm SOC stocks, respectively. This study demonstrates that the accuracy of regional-scale SOC mapping of California rangelands benefits from considering microclimatic and topographic controls at the catchment-scale, in addition to broader scale mineralogical and macroclimatic controls identified in previous SOC studies.","[Devine, Scott M.; O'Geen, Anthony T.; Liu, Han; Jin, Yufang; Dahlke, Helen E.; Dahlgren, Randy A.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Land Air & Water Resources, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Larsen, Royce E.] Univ Calif Cooperat Extens, San Luis Obispo, CA 90001 USA",,"Devine, Scott/0000-0002-2306-8281",Russell L.

However, there is a lack of tools based on objective observations for assessing cropland C budgets at the plot scale over large areas. Such tools would allow us to more precisely establish the contribution of an agricultural plot to net CO2 emissions according to the plot management and identify levers for improving the C budget. In this study, we present a diagnostic regional modelling approach, called SAFY-CO2, that assimilates high spatial and temporal resolution (HSTR) optical remote sensing data in a simple crop model and evaluate the performance of this approach in quantifying crop production and the main components of the annual carbon budget for winter wheat. The SAFY-CO2 model simulates daily crop development (biomass, partition to leaves, etc.), the components of net ecosystem CO2 fluxes, and the annual yield and net ecosystem carbon budget (NECB). Multi-temporal green area index (GAI) maps derived from HSTR data from the Formosat-2 and SPOT satellites were used to calibrate the light-use efficiency and phenological parameters of the model. Data from the literature were used to set a priori values for a set of model parameters, and a large dataset of in situ data was used for model validation. This dataset includes 8 years of eddy-covariance net CO2 flux measurements and GAL biomass and yield data acquired at 2 instrumented sites in southwest France. Biomass and yield data from 16 fields in the study area between 2005 and 2014 were also used for validation. The SAFY-CO2 model is able to reproduce both GAI dynamics (RRMSE = 14%, R-2 = 0.97) and biomass production and yield (RRMSE of 27% and 21%, respectively) with high precisions under contrasting climatic, environmental and management conditions. Additionally, the net CO2 flux components estimated by the model generally agreed well with in situ data and presented very good and significant correlations (RMSE of 1.74, 1.13 and 1.29 gC.m(-2).d for GPP, R-eco and NEE, respectively; R-2 of 0.90, 0.75 and 0.85 for GPP, R-eco and NEE, respectively) over the 8 studied years. This study also highlights the importance of accounting for post-harvest vegetative events (spontaneous re-growth, weed development and cover crops) for an accurate calculation of the annual net CO2 flux. This approach requires a limited number of input parameters for estimating yield and net CO2 flux components, which is promising for regional/global-scale applications based on Sentinel 2-like data; however, the approach requires plot-scale data concerning organic amendments and straw management (exportation) in animal farming systems to calculate field C budgets.","[Pique, Gaetan; Fieuzal, Remy; Al Bitar, Ahmad; Veloso, Amanda; Tallec, Tiphaine; Brut, Aurore; Ferlicoq, Morgan; Zawilski, Bartosz; Dejoux, Jean-Francois; Gibrin, Herve] Univ Toulouse, CESBIO, CNES CNRS INRA IRD UPS, Toulouse, France; [Pique, Gaetan] Agence Environm & Maitrise Energie ADEME, Angers 1, France; [Ceschia, Eric] INRA, USC CESBIO 1439, Toulouse, France",,"ceschia, eric E/0000-0001-5941-752X; Zawilski, Bartosz Marian/0000-0001-9155-1331",Agence De l'Environnement et de la Maitrise de l'Energie (ADEME); Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales (CNES); Agence de l'Eau Adour Garonne (AEAG); European Union [730074]; Institut National des Sciences de l'Univers of the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS-INSU) through the ICOS observatory; Institut National des Sciences de l'Univers of the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS-INSU) through the OSR SW observatory; University Toulouse III - Paul Sabatier; CNES; Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD),Agence De l'Environnement et de la Maitrise de l'Energie (ADEME); Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales (CNES)(Centre National D'etudes Spatiales); Agence de l'Eau Adour Garonne (AEAG); European Union(European Commission); Institut National des Sciences de l'Univers of the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS-INSU) through the ICOS observatory; Institut National des Sciences de l'Univers of the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS-INSU) through the OSR SW observatory; University Toulouse III - Paul Sabatier; CNES(Centre National D'etudes Spatiales); Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD),"This work was made possible through the support of the Agence De l'Environnement et de la Maitrise de l'Energie (ADEME), which financed the project Couverts Intermediaires pour l'attenuation du Changement Climatique (CICC) and half of Gaetan's and Morgan's PhDs, the Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales (CNES), which financed half of Gaetan's PhD, and the Agence de l'Eau Adour Garonne (AEAG), which financed the Bag'ages project and the support of the European Union that financed the Sensagri project (Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme, Grant Agreement n degrees 730074).; Data acquisition at FR-Lam and FR-Aur were mainly funded by the Institut National des Sciences de l'Univers of the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS-INSU) through the ICOS and OSR SW observatories.

This study aimed to explore the potential of airborne hyperspectral image to estimate the SOC of bare topsoil at an agricultural site located in the southeast part of Iowa State, United States. To magnify the subtle spectral signals concerning SOC, and accelerate calibration and improve predictive ability, we developed a framework to combine two advanced spectral algorithms, namely, fractional-order derivative (FOD) and optimal band combination algorithm for SOC predicting. Our case was based on 49 soil samples and a scattered airborne hyperspectral image. Random forest (RF) was utilized to establish SOC estimation models by incorporating the optimal spectral indices processed by different FOD transformations on the basis of the optimal band combination algorithm. Results indicated that when the fractional order increased, overlapping peaks and baseline drifts were gradually removed. However, the magnitude of spectral strength decreased concurrently. More detailed and abundant spectral variability was captured by FOD as compared with those by original reflectance and first and second derivatives. The estimation accuracies developed from the optimal band combination algorithm (cross validation R-2, 0.36-0.66) were generally better than those from full-spectrum data (cross-validation R-2, 0.32-0.54). The RF model based on the combination of 0.75-order reflectance and optimal band combination algorithm obtained the highest estimation accuracy for SOC with cross-validation R-2 of 0.66. This research provides guidance for future studies in selecting the most appropriate FOD transformation to preprocess spectral data and in using the optimal band combination algorithm to determine the spectral index. Airborne hyperspectral image-based modeling can be further used to map agricultural topsoil SOC to support local-scale agricultural planning.","[Hong, Yongsheng; Chen, Yiyun; Liu, Yaolin; Liu, Yanfang; Cheng, Hang; Liu, Yi] Wuhan Univ, Sch Resource & Environm Sci, Wuhan 430079, Peoples R China; [Hong, Yongsheng; Mouazen, Abdul M.] Univ Ghent, Dept Environm, Coupure Links 653, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Guo, Long] Huazhong Agr Univ, Coll Resources & Environm, Wuhan 430070, Peoples R China; [Chen, Songchao] INRA, Unite InfoSol, F-45075 Orleans, France; [Chen, Songchao] INRA, UMR SAS, Agrocampus, F-35042 Rennes, France; [Linderman, Marc] Univ Iowa, Geog & Sustainabil Sci, Iowa City, IA 52246 USA; [Yu, Lei] Cent China Normal Univ, Sch Urban & Environm Sci, Wuhan 430079, Peoples R China; [Yu, Lei] Cent China Normal Univ, Key Lab Geog Proc Anal & Simulat Hubei Prov, Wuhan 430079, Peoples R China; [Chen, Yiyun] Chinese Acad Sci, State Key Lab Soil & Sustainable Agr, Nanjing 210008, Peoples R China",,"Chen, Songchao/0000-0003-1245-0482; Mouazen, Abdul M./0000-0002-0354-0067",National Natural Science Foundation of China [41771440]; China Scholarship Council [201906270092]; Research Foundation - Flanders (FWO) [G0F9216N],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); China Scholarship Council(China Scholarship Council); Research Foundation - Flanders (FWO)(FWO),"This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant numbers: 41771440).

The spatial heterogeneity of farmland SOC is not only influence by the environmental factors of soil formation but also the management practices of tillage, fertilization, and irrigation. However, the traditional modeling covariates of digital soil mapping, such as terrain factors, land use types and climate factors have weak spatial variations in low-relief agricultural areas, and they cannot reflect the large spatial variation of SOC. Thus the time-series multispectral remote sensing images will be used for mapping soil properties in low relief regions in this study, meanwhile a new collaborative verification strategy was put forward to evaluate the spatial distribution characteristics of soil maps. The current study was performed in a nearly flat agricultural region southeast of Iowa (with an area of approximately 385.45 ha), where 195 surface soil samples (0-15 cm) were collected. A hyperspectral image (Headwall-Hyperspec, 380-1700 nm) and the time-series multispectral remote sensing images of Sentinel 2 and Landsat 8 were used to construct the prediction models of SOC stock and its relevant soil properties of SOC and soil bulk density (SBD) through partial least square regression (PLSR) and extreme learning machine (ELM) models. The collected soil samples and evaluation indexes of root mean square error (RMSE), R-2, and ratio of performance to interquartile range (RPIQ) were used to evaluate the model performance. Results are as follows: (1) hyperspectral images were successfully used to predict the SOC stock, SOC, and SBD through PLSR and ELM, while ELM (RPIQ = 2.03, 1.97, 1.64) outperformed PLSR (RPIQ = 1.83, 1.97, 1.53); (2) the time-series multispectral remote sensing images of Sentinel 2 and Landsat 8 can reflect the spatial distribution characteristics of the SOC stock, SOC and SBD by PLSR and ELM, but the combination of Sentinel 2 images and ELM obtained the best prediction results (RPIQ = 1.45, 1.25, 1.26); and (3) the differences of the soil maps predicted by the hyperspectral image and time-series multispectral remote sensing images were small, and the largest percentage errors nearly appeared on the edges of the farmland patches owing to mixed pixels. This study further confirmed the good prediction abilities of the time-series multispectral remote sensing images in low relief farmland regions. Lastly, this mapping strategy can provide additional valuable information for agricultural management and carbon cycle.","[Guo, Long; Sun, Xiaoru; Dang, Lina; Zhang, Haitao; Zeng, Chen] Huazhong Agr Univ, Coll Resources & Environm, Wuhan 430070, Peoples R China; [Guo, Long; Sun, Xiaoru; Dang, Lina; Zhang, Haitao; Zeng, Chen] Huazhong Agr Univ, Res Ctr Terr Spatial Governance & Green Dev, Wuhan 430070, Peoples R China; [Fu, Peng] Univ Illinois, Dept Plant Biol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Shi, Tiezhu] Shenzhen Univ, Key Lab Geoenvironm Monitoring Coastal Zone, Natl Adm Surveying Mapping & Geolnformat, Shenzhen 518060, Peoples R China; [Shi, Tiezhu] Shenzhen Univ, Shenzhen Key Lab Spatial Smart Sensing & Serv, Shenzhen 518060, Peoples R China; [Shi, Tiezhu] Shenzhen Univ, Coll Life Sci & Oceanog, Shenzhen 518060, Peoples R China; [Chen, Yiyun] Wuhan Univ, Sch Resource & Environm Sci, Wuhan 430079, Peoples R China; [Linderman, M.] Univ Iowa, Geog & Sustainabil Sci, Iowa City, IA 52246 USA; [Guo, Long; Zhang, Ganlin] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Soil Sci, Nanjing 210008, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Yu] Huazhong Agr Univ, Coll Hort & Forestry Sci, Hubei Engn Technol Res Ctr Forestry Informat, Wuhan 430070, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Qinghu] Chinese Acad Sci, Wuhan Bot Garden, Wuhan 430079, Peoples R China",,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [41890854, 41771251]; Open Project of the Key Laboratory of Aquatic Plants and Watershed Ecology [Y852721s04]; Independent Technology Innovation Fund of Huazhong Agricultural University [26620208HPY006]; Natural Science Foundation of Hubei [2018CFB372]; Open Project of the MNR Key Laboratory for GeoEnvironmental Monitoring of the Great Bay Area",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Open Project of the Key Laboratory of Aquatic Plants and Watershed Ecology; Independent Technology Innovation Fund of Huazhong Agricultural University; Natural Science Foundation of Hubei(Natural Science Foundation of Hubei Province); Open Project of the MNR Key Laboratory for GeoEnvironmental Monitoring of the Great Bay Area,"This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41890854, 41771251), Open Project of the Key Laboratory of Aquatic Plants and Watershed Ecology (Y852721s04), Independent Technology Innovation Fund of Huazhong Agricultural University (26620208HPY006), Natural Science Foundation of Hubei (2018CFB372), and Open Project of the MNR Key Laboratory for GeoEnvironmental Monitoring of the Great Bay Area.",,65.0,14.0,15.0,ELSEVIER,0016-7061,1872-6259,,GEODERMA,Geoderma,15-Sep,2021,398,,115118,10.1016/j.geoderma.2021.115118,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2021.115118,21-Apr,16.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Q1

Peatland restoration aims at mitigating that situation by supporting CO2 uptake in these areas through raising the water table, in this way creating conditions for vegetation development and organic matter accumulation. We analysed the relationships between recovering vegetation and CO2 fluxes on three abandoned peat excavation sites in northern Estonia, which were rewetted and restored using the moss-layer-transfer technique three to ten years before the first measurements. Using chamber measurements, we determined whether these sites were CO2 sinks or sources during two growing seasons in 2015 (drier) and 2016 (wetter). In the drier growing season, all sites were CO2 sources from the peatland to the atmosphere (emissions from 1 to 77 g CO2 m(-2)), while in the wetter growing season, two sites were CO2 sinks (uptake from 13 to 210 g CO2 m(-2)). CO2 uptake was higher with higher plant and Eriophorum vaginatum cover, and biomass and cover of Sphagnum. The remotely sensed Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) explained about 25% of variation in Net Ecosystem Exchange; CO2 uptake was higher in plots with higher NDVI values. This provides a potential avenue of investigation of developing remote sensing methods in assessing spatial pattern of CO2 fluxes in restored peatlands. In order to increase CO2 uptake in abandoned milled peatlands, it is essential to raise the water level and thus reduce peat oxidation and create conditions for the development of vegetation similar to pristine peatlands.","[Purre, Anna-Helena; Pajula, Raimo; Ilomets, Mati] Tallinn Univ, Inst Ecol, Uus Sadama 5, EE-10120 Tallinn, Estonia",,,Tallinn University Centre of Excellence of Natural Sciences and Sustainable Development; Estonian Geographical Society; Estonian Environmental Investment Centre [09-09-1/558]; Life + Climate mitigation Project Reduction of CO2 emissions by restoring degraded peatlands in Northern European Lowland [LIFE15 CCM/DE/000138],Tallinn University Centre of Excellence of Natural Sciences and Sustainable Development; Estonian Geographical Society; Estonian Environmental Investment Centre(Estonian Research Council); Life + Climate mitigation Project Reduction of CO2 emissions by restoring degraded peatlands in Northern European Lowland,"This research was supported by Tallinn University Centre of Excellence of Natural Sciences and Sustainable Development, scholarship of prof.

Even so, drivers of soil C total and labile pools are little understood for smallholder farms. A unique opportunity to evaluate how environment conditions management drivers was afforded by a systematically representative on-farm study of 1108 cultivated plots in marginal to mesic environments across Central and Southern Malawi. Soil sample collection and analysis and surveys of farmer practice were conducted, and linked to remote-sensed data on environmental and spectral factors. Soil properties included the following ranges (mean values per site), soil clay (6.41% to 17.36%), pH (6.09 to 6.54), soil organic carbon (SOC) (6.31 g C kg soil-1 to 16.17 g C kg soil-1), and two labile soil C assays: permanganate oxidizable carbon (POXC) (291.5 mg C kg soil-1 to 504.5 mg C kg soil-1) and 24-h mineralizable C (Cmin) (28.71 mg C kg soil-1 to 65.34 mg C kg soil-1). Incorporation of domain specialists' expectation of uncertainty levels is key to carrying out a multiscale assessment of soil total and labile C status, thus a Bayesian linear regression approach was used for determining the influential drivers. Overall, the soil clay content is a strong predictor of SOC (0.479-0.517), POXC (0.139-0.266), and Cmin (0.125-0.223) at the 95% Bayesian credibility level from the Gibbs posterior samples. Vegetative cover, reflected by Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), is also a dominant driver for SOC (0.234-0.329), POXC (0.163-0.285), and Cmin (0.249-0.38). Of the management practices studied, crop diversity, residue incorporation, and weed presence are all positive drivers for total soil C, whereas fertilizer N is not. At both regional and local scales, labile soil C pools (as reflected by POXC and Cmin) are not consistently responsive to management. The drivers of SOC are highly consistent, a strong indication of statistical robustness. This contributes to the understanding of patterns of carbon pools in intensively cultivated fields in Sub-Saharan Africa.","[Tu, Xinyi; Snapp, Sieglinde] Michigan State Univ, Dept Pant Soil & Microbial Sci, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Tu, Xinyi] Michigan State Univ, Environm Sci & Policy Program, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Viens, Frederi] Michigan State Univ, Dept Stat & Probabil, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Viens, Frederi] Michigan State Univ, Actuarial Sci Program, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",,"Snapp, Sieglinde/0000-0002-9738-0649",United States Agency for International Development (USAID) [AID-OAA-A-13-00006]; International Institute of Tropical Agriculture; Michigan State University; USAID [AID-BFS-IO-15-00001],United States Agency for International Development (USAID)(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)CGIAR); International Institute of Tropical Agriculture(CGIAR); Michigan State University; USAID(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)),"This study was funded by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID, Grant AID-OAA-A-13-00006) as part of the US Governments Feed the Future Initiative funded project entitled Africa RISING (Research in Sustainable Intensification for the Next Generation) with support from International Institute of Tropical Agriculture.

Soil maps were desirable for purposes of land valuation for taxation, agronomic planning, and even in military operations. Soil mapping required classification systems that would allow communication of mapped information, classification systems required understanding of the soil system, and gaining that understanding included the creation of soil models. Therefore, advancement in one of these highly interrelated areas tended to lead to corresponding advances in the others, and these relationships persist into the modem era. Although many advances in our understanding of the soil system have been made since the late 1800s, when soil science blossomed into a scientific discipline in its own right, there are still many unanswered questions and additional needs in soil mapping, classification, and pedologic modeling. New technologies including GPS, GIS, remote sensing, on-site geophysical instrumentation (EMI, GPR, PXRF, etc.), and the development of statistical and geostatistical techniques have greatly increased our ability to collect, analyze, and predict spatial information related to soils, but linking all of this new information to soil properties and processes can still be a challenge and enhanced pedologic models are needed. The expansion of the use of soil knowledge to address issues beyond agronomic production, such as land use planning, environmental concerns, food security, energy security, water security, and human health, to name a few, requires new ways to communicate what we know about the soils we map as well as bringing forth research questions that were not widely considered in earlier soils studies. At present this information is communicated using dozens of national soil classification systems as well as WRB, but a more universal soil classification system would facilitate international communication of soils information. There are still many significant needs in the area of soil mapping, classification, and pedologic modeling going into the future. (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In this sense, remote sensing products have shown their power to investigate soil properties, but the assessment of its spatial information can be hampered by the presence of other objects than soil. To overcome this issue, soil scientists have been studying spatial patterns from multi-temporal satellite images aiming at at improving soil property maps. In this work, we applied the cubist algorithm to predict topsoil properties (clay, sand, organic matter and iron contents, and soil color components) in south-eastern Brazil using multi-temporal (Landsat8-OLI, and Sentinel2-MSI) and single-date images (PlanetScope, Landsat8-OLI, and Sentinel2-MSI). We aimed to evaluate the influence of satellite's spatial, spectral and temporal resolutions on soil mapping. Predictive models were constructed with 120 soil samples and using four (vis-NIR) and six (vis-NIR-SWIR) spectral bands as predictors in a 10-fold cross-validation procedure. The multi-temporal image obtained from the Sentinel2-MSI satellite (with 10 m pixel size and six spectral bands), showed the best model performances in cross-validation (R-2 between 0.48 and 0.78). The PlanetScope image, which has only four bands in the vis-NIR region and spatial resolution of 3 m did not improve model performances, although the R-2 values were higher for soil color components (R-2 > 0.5). Satellite images in different spatial, spectral and temporal resolution provides slightly different soil property maps which may promote different strategies regarding soil classification and management.

These attributes are relevant for the preservation and proper management of land use in the pursuit of a sustainable agriculture. Laboratory and satellite sensors have been applied as a powerful tool for studying so is, but their analysis using these sensors has mainly focused on the visible (Vis), near infrared (NIR) and shortwave infrared (SWIR) regions of the electro-magnetic spectrum, with few studies in the Medium Infrared (MIR). The aim of this study was to identify the spectral pattern of soils with different granulometry (sand and clay) and OC content using laboratory and satellite sensors in the MIR region, specifically in the Thermal Infrared (TIR) range (ASTER, Landsat satellites). The study performed qualitative and quantitative analyses of clay, OC and sand fractions (fine and coarse). The study area is located in the region of Piracicaba, Sao Paulo, Brazil, where collected 150 soil samples (0-20 cm depth). Soil texture was determined by the pipette method and OC via dry combustion. Reflectance and emissivity (epsilon) spectral data were obtained with the Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) Alpha sensor (Bruker Optics Corporation). An image ASTER 05 from July 15, 2017 was acquired with values of epsilon. Samples were separated by textural classes and the spectral behavior in the TIR region was described. The data obtained by the laboratory sensor were resampled to the satellite sensor bands. The behavior between spectra of both sensors was similar and had significant correlation with the studied attributes, mainly sand. For the partial least squares regression (PLSR) models, six strategies were used (MIR, MIR_ASTER, ASTER, TIR, TIR Correlation Index (TIR_CID), and MIR Correlation Index (MIR_CID)), which consisted in the use of all sensors bands, or by the selection of bands that presented the most significant correlations with each one of the attributes. Models presented a good performance in the prediction of all attributes using the whole MIR. In the TIR region, the models for total sand content and for fine and coarse fractions were good. Models created with ASTER sensor data were not as promising as those with laboratory ones. The use of specific bands was useful in estimating some attributes in the MIR and TIR, improving the predictive performance and validation of models. Therefore, the discrimination of soil attributes with satellite sensors can be improved with the identification of specific bands, as observed in the results with laboratory sensors.","[Salazar, Diego F.

However, existing grid-based or non-grid-based digital soil mapping (DSM) can lead to the problem of mixed units of input information, which causes the mapping results to be unsuitable for direct use in guiding the implementation of precision agriculture. Instead, the goal of this study was to achieve DSM based on land parcels, which are the basic units of agricultural management and have practical geographical significance for precision mapping in agricultural areas. This study established a convolutional neural network-based automatic extraction model to extract land parcels from high resolution remote sensing images. Thirty environmental covariates were chosen and calibrated at land parcels to establish the relationships between soils and landscapes. Four prediction algorithms, namely, ordinary kriging, cokriging, random forest and artificial neural network, were combined with the land-parcel-based DSM framework to develop and evaluate their effectiveness in predicting four topsoil nutrient properties in an alluvial-diluvia plain agricultural region located in Ningxia province, China. The results of comparisons show that, overall, the land-parcel-based RF model achieved the best prediction accuracy; its relative improvement (RMSE%) values over the competing models were 1.27, 4.23, 3.19 and 9.01 for soil organic matter, soil total nitrogen, available phosphorus and available potassium, respectively. In addition, land-parcel-based mapping can improve algorithmic efficiency by approximately 4 times by effectively reducing the mapping units for complex agricultural areas compared with the grid-based mapping results when using the same algorithm, and it also achieves a better performance at the detail level. Overall, the land-parcel-based DSM approach achieved good results in plain agricultural areas, but the model still needs improvement for land-parcel-based DSM in mountainous and hilly agricultural areas, and a challenge remains in selecting the most appropriate environmental covariates.","[Dong, Wen; Luo, Jiancheng; Sun, Yingwei] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Remote Sensing & Digital Earth, State Key Lab Remote Sensing Sci, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Wu, Tianjun] Changan Univ, Coll Sci, Dept Math & Informat Sci, Xian 710064, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Xia, Liegang] Zhejiang Univ Technol, Coll Comp Sci & Technol, Hangzhou 310014, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",,"Sun, Yingwei/0000-0002-3051-3259","National Key Research and Development Program, China [2017YFB0503600]; Beijing Municipal Natural Science Foundation, China [4172064]; National Natural Science Foundation of China, China [41631179]","National Key Research and Development Program, China; Beijing Municipal Natural Science Foundation, China(Beijing Natural Science Foundation); National Natural Science Foundation of China, China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC))","This work was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program, China [grant number 2017YFB0503600], Beijing Municipal Natural Science Foundation, China [grant number 4172064] and National Natural Science Foundation of China, China [grant number 41631179].",,75.0,29.0,32.0,ELSEVIER,0016-7061,1872-6259,,GEODERMA,Geoderma,15-Apr,2019,340,,,10.1016/j.geoderma.2019.01.018,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2019.01.018,,15.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Q1

The 4 per 1000 (4p1000) initiative, launched during the COP 21 in Paris in 2015, based on translating the science of soil carbon sequestration into action at the global scale, is one example of a broader set of negative emission technologies (NETs). While governments and non-governmental organizations are voluntarily implementing the aspirational 4p1000, its adoption and pledges by industry or the private sector is the driving force to accelerate the process of re-carbonization of soil and the terrestrial biosphere. The pledge of achieving carbon (C) neutrality by 2030 or 2050 by some prominent industries is encouraging, and it can serve as a role model for other industries to follow. Adoption of the 4p1000 concept by agro-industries (e.g., fertilizers, pesticides, farm machinery, irrigation, food processing) can promote and accelerate adoption of recommended management practices which create a positive/soil ecosystem carbon budget and enhance C sequestration. This review article describes examples of the emission-neutral concept already adopted by some industries, outlines strategies to promote 4p1000 and NETs, and discusses approaches to advance site-specific NETs. These techniques may include conservation agriculture, cover cropping, precision agriculture, etc., facilitated by artificial intelligence, remote sensing, and robots. Innovative methods of soil sampling as well as remote sensing and mapping of SOC stock are pertinent to promoting NETs and 4p1000. Payments to land managers and farmers for provisioning of ecosystem services through C sequestration in soil and the biosphere can advance the mission of 4p1000. Amongst strategies of encouraging industries to adopt NETs, implementation of a Healthy Soil Act at the state, national, and global level could be a step in the right direction. Market-based economic incentives to industry may be another option to promote adoption of NETs. Similar to U.S. EPA Clean Air Act of 1963 and the U.S. EPA Clean Water Act of 1972, there is a strong need to enact a Healthy Soil Act globally. An effective implementation of the trinity of Acts (air, water, and soil) at the national and global scale will accelerate the process of re-carbonization of the soil and the terrestrial biosphere while also strengthening the provisioning of essential ecosystem services.","[Lal, Rattan] Ohio State Univ, Carbon Management & Sequestrat Ctr, Columbus, OH 43210 USA",,,,,,,111.0,5.0,5.0,ELSEVIER,0016-7061,1872-6259,,GEODERMA,Geoderma,15-Nov,2020,378,,114613,10.1016/j.geoderma.2020.114613,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2020.114613,,9.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Q1

While soil maps exist in Saskatchewan, they are at coarse scales (1:100,000), which are not always suitable for detailed soil management. One emerging technique for predictive soil mapping is the use of bare soil composite imagery derived from multi-temporal satellite imagery. This study focused on using bare soil composite imagery along with legacy soil data (1958-1998) with high location uncertainty to predict soil organic carbon, clay, and cation exchange capacity. The bare soil composite images were created from Landsat 5 imagery (1985 to 1995) using Google Earth Engine. Predictive models were built using a Random Forest model for each parameter and evaluated using a 75-25 train-test split. The soil organic carbon model had an R-2 value of 0.55 with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.67 percent, with the near infrared and visible light bands being the most important features in the model. The clay predictive model has an R-2 of 0.44 and a RMSE of 5.0 percent, with the shortwave infrared bands being most important. The cation exchange capacity model had an R-2 of 0.50 with a RMSE of 5.7 meq 100 g(-1), with the shortwave and near infrared bands as the most important predictors. Based on these results, bare soil composite imagery represents a valuable covariate for predictive soil mapping in the Canadian Prairies. This work also illustrates that for regions with extensive adoption of conservation farming practices, satellite imagery should be obtained for time periods before these practices were adopted from the months of the year where crop residues have decomposed. By combining historical soil survey data with historical imagery, maps of legacy soil properties can be generated to make comparisons against with modern data for applications such as monitoring soil organic carbon change over time.","[Sorenson, P.

We performed UAS analysis on the Hoosfield Spring Barley experiment at Rothamsted (UK) where adjacent plots with distinctly different SOC contents, due to different long-term management practices, provide a valuable resource to evaluate this approach.

In some regions, shifting precipitation patterns in the spring and fall are negatively impacting farm operation by reducing the number of ‚Äúworkable days‚Äù or the days fields can be worked with heavy equipment without damaging soil structure. This can be particularly problematic for farms on clay soils and/or poor drainage. Approximating a water content threshold at which a soil is not workable due to soil structure destruction can be helpful for planning effective farm operations. In this study, we applied advanced remote sensing and machine learning tools to produce digital maps of soil organic carbon (SOC) and clay (CL) content and used them in existing pedotransfer functions (PTFs) to predict a workability threshold (WT) across a study area in Delta, British Columbia, Canada. We combined field data, soil and vegetation indices derived from multiple Landsat satellite images, topographic indices, and soil survey information to digitally map SOC and CL of the agricultural lands in Delta using random forest (RF) and generalized boosted regression model (GBM). When validated against an independent field dataset, the RF model outperformed GBM for all accuracy measures (coefficient of determination ‚Äì R2, concordance correlation coefficient ‚Äì CCC, and normalized root mean square error ‚Äì nRMSE). We then spatially applied several PTFs using our digital maps to estimate the plasticity limits of the soil and produce WT map. The WT map was then tested against independent field samples of the soil water content at ‚àí10 kPa and we achieved R2 of 0.59, CCC of 0.70, and nRMSE of 0.15. Our analysis showed that 40% of the fields in the study area had WT &lt; 30%, a threshold that is already being impacted by reduced workable days. This WT map could be used to improve spatial prioritizations of investments for climate change adaptation at farm to regional scales. ¬© 2020 Elsevier B.V.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2020,363,,,10.1016/j.geoderma.2020.114177,,,,55634366000;54790508000;56205607900;6701849751;57213456582;23986977300;,114177,,,,13.0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85077808358&doi=10.1016%2fj.geoderma.2020.114177&partnerID=40&md5=cf014621dbc1c73b1e95a7f5985c6f77,Agriculture; Clay; Decision trees; Mean square error; Organic carbon; Plasticity; Regression analysis; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Soil moisture; Soil surveys; Clay content; LANDSAT; Random forests; Soil organic carbon; Soil plasticity; Climate change; adaptive management; agricultural production; algorithm; clay; climate change; digital mapping; Landsat; mapping method; NDVI; organic carbon; plasticity; prediction; regression analysis; remote sensing; satellite imagery; soil analysis; soil carbon; soil structure; soil survey; threshold; British Columbia; Canada,English,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85077808358,,,,Q1

As the cropland expansion took place in Brazil the last decades, leading to significant land-use change and environmental impacts, detailed information about soils is fundamental for sustainable development. Thus, considering the lack of spatially explicit information about cropland soils in Brazil, we aimed at performing high-resolution mapping of key topsoil attributes using spectral and terrain features extracted from Earth observation data (EOD). With the resulting information, we also aimed at performing a general examination of the main agricultural regions and estimate the total organic carbon stocks on croplands soils. For this, we obtained environmental predictors from the historical collection of Landsat data and the digital elevation model from Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission at the cloud-based platform of Google Earth Engine. The environmental predictors (30 m spatial resolution) with georeferenced soil samples (n = 5097) were used for predicting the topsoil content (0‚Äì20 cm) of clay, sand, silt, cation exchange capacity, pH, soil organic carbon (SOC) and SOC stock. Prediction models of clay, sand, SOC content, and SOC stocks had the best performance metrics, achieving a R2 ranging from 0.44 to 0.74 and ratio of performance to the interquartile range higher than 1.5. The predicted maps revealed the variability of topsoil among the cropped areas, indicating that the agricultural expansion took place on sandy soils. The SOC stock map provided consistent estimates compared to previous datasets but revealed additional information at the local and regional scales.

There are many estimation strategies with the potential for more reliable estimates of SOC stock and more efficient use of soil sampling and analysis resources, especially by leveraging readily available auxiliary information such as remote sensing. However, concrete guidance for strategy selection is lacking. This study narrows this gap with a comparison of strategies for estimating deep SOC stock (0‚Äì60 cm) in a prototypical field. Using high density SOC stock measurements and simulation, we built on past studies by 1) ex-ante evaluating a large number of strategy options, 2) using a Bayesian approach to quantify the uncertainty of the comparison, and 3) considering multiple Bayesian models to assess sensitivity to this modeling choice. We found that, using readily available auxiliary information, both balanced and stratified sampling offer substantial improvements over simple random sampling. The auxiliary information most important for this improvement is a Sentinel-2 SOC index = blue / (green √ó red), followed by the topographic wetness index. We found that these results are robust to the choice of mapping method, but that there is uncertainty in the magnitude of improvement. We recommend future studies implement this Bayesian approach for simulated ex-ante evaluation of SOC stock estimation strategies across more fields to investigate the generalizability of these findings. ¬© 2022 Elsevier B.V.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2022,411,,,10.1016/j.geoderma.2021.115693,,,,56925446300;56382070400;56145435900;9044435900;35553263900;57221277104;55963785100;,115693,,,,2.0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85122622997&doi=10.1016%2fj.geoderma.2021.115693&partnerID=40&md5=54bfcfc694f1cdaf437171579e354666,Agriculture; Organic carbon; Remote sensing; Soils; Uncertainty analysis; Agricultural fields; Auxiliary information; Bayesian; Bayesian approaches; Estimation strategies; Evaluation; Ex ante evaluation; Geo-statistics; Soil carbon stock; Soil organic Carbon stocks; Bayesian networks; Bayesian analysis; mapping method; organic carbon; sampling; Sentinel; soil carbon; sustainability,English,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85122622997,,,,Q1

Digital SOC mapping is essential for agricultural production management. Digital SOC mapping based on multi-source remote sensing data has been integrated well into prediction models and methodological approaches on different mapping scales. However, the mixed use of synthetic images and the application of the hybrid model considering the soil classification probability are rare. Here, we propose a probability hybrid model to estimate and map SOC content and distribution. Multi-temporal synthetic images were used to build the probability hybrid model. One hundred forty topsoil samples were collected in Suihua, a city in a typical black soil region in China. Cloud-free Sentinel-2 images were acquired from the bare soil periods between 2018 and 2021. Minimum, maximum, mean, and median synthetic images were calculated using single images from the same period. The random forest and support vector machine models were used for discriminating soil class and calculating soil classification probability, and then random forest regression model was applied to SOC mapping. Soil class mapping and classification probability were performed for Phaeozems, Chernozems, and Cambisols of the World Reference Base for Soil Resources (WRB) based on soil texture, climatic factors, and the normalized differential vegetation index (NDVI). Based on soil class mapping results, global models using single temporal images and multi-temporal images, the hybrid model using multi-temporal images for the three soil classes as well as a probability hybrid model using multi-temporal images were built and compared their SOC predictions. Our study showed that (1) Phaeozems, Chernozems and Cambisols could be classified accurately, and the overall validation accuracy of random forest model was 91.67%. (2) The correlations of SOC with bands and band indices improved using multi-temporal images, and the use of mixed synthetic images was better than the use of only one synthetic image. (3) The hybrid model performed far better than the global models, and the probability hybrid model led to the highest prediction accuracy, a validation R2 of 0.77 and an RMSE of 2.30 g kg‚àí1. (4) The probability hybrid model was more accurate than the original hybrid model for digital SOC mapping, and the SOC distribution in boundary regions was smoother and more continuous.

Reflectance spectroscopy has been recognized as a promising method to rapidly estimate SOM content. However, the existing estimation methods mainly apply partial least squares regression (PLSR) to the entire spectral region of hyperspectral data. Here we proposed a method to extract the informative spectral subset based on spectral characteristics of soil constituents, which was then used to estimate SOM content with PLSR. Genetic algorithm (GA) and variable importance in the projection (VIP) score of PLSR were adopted to further select spectral bands separately. Both laboratory spectra of soil samples collected from an agricultural area and a hyperspectral satellite image were used to evaluate the performance of the method. For the estimations of SOM content using laboratory spectra, compared with the estimation using the entire spectral region of 400‚Äì2400 nm, the model accuracy was improved by using the spectral bands associated with clay minerals and the combined spectral bands of organic matter and clay minerals. For the estimations using soil spectra from hyperspectral remote sensing image, the RMSE and R2 values were improved from 0.91% and 0.34 to 0.55% and 0.76 by using the spectral bands associated with organic matter in comparison with the entire spectral region of 390‚Äì1029 nm.

Despite the wide recognition of the importance of these services, drivers of soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics across various land uses in East Africa are poorly understood. The objectives of this study were threefold: to quantify SOC stocks across Tanzania; assess the effect of land cover and erosion on SOC; and investigate the relationship between inherent and dynamic soil properties under diverse land uses. The Land Degradation Surveillance Framework (LDSF) was used to assess the variability of ecological metrics at different spatial scales. SOC was quantified within and between different land cover types (forest, woodland, shrubland, grassland and cropland) in Tanzania. A total of 2052 soil samples from 1082-1000m2 plots were collected from seven 100-km2 sentinel sites in 2010. Composite soil samples were collected at each plot from two depths (0-20 and 20-50cm) and cumulative soil mass samples were collected to 100cm. Soil samples were analyzed using a combination of traditional analytical laboratory methods and mid-infrared spectroscopy (MIR). Model performance of MIR spectral predictions for carbon was good, with an R2 of &gt;0.95 and RMSEP of 4.3gkg-1, when using an independent validation datasets. Woodland and cropland were the most frequently occurring vegetation structure types in the sampled sites, with 388 and 246 plots, respectively. Average topsoil OC (and range) was 12.4 (1.5-81.4) gCkg-1 (n=1082) and average subsoil OC (and range) was 7.3 (0.64-53.8) gCkg-1 (n=970) for the seven sites. Forested plots had the highest mean topsoil organic carbon concentrations (17.3gCkg-1) followed by cropland (13.3gCkg-1), for all sites included in the study, but with high levels of variability between sites. Soil mass at 30cm was measured and these data were used to calculate carbon stocks for the different land cover types. An approach based on remote sensing was explored for the mapping of SOC stocks at 30cm for Tanzania using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) imagery from 2012. Results indicate that the use of image reflectance for the mapping of SOC stocks has promising potential, with R2 values ranging from 0.77 to 0.81 and RMSEP values from 0.90 to 1.03kgm-2 for the three validation datasets.

The ‚Äú4 per 1000‚Äù (4p1000) initiative, launched during the COP 21 in Paris in 2015, based on translating the science of soil carbon sequestration into action at the global scale, is one example of a broader set of negative emission technologies (NETs). While governments and non-governmental organizations are voluntarily implementing the aspirational 4p1000, its adoption and pledges by industry or the private sector is the driving force to accelerate the process of re-carbonization of soil and the terrestrial biosphere. The pledge of achieving carbon (C) neutrality by 2030 or 2050 by some prominent industries is encouraging, and it can serve as a role model for other industries to follow. Adoption of the 4p1000 concept by agro-industries (e.g., fertilizers, pesticides, farm machinery, irrigation, food processing) can promote and accelerate adoption of recommended management practices which create a positive/soil ecosystem carbon budget and enhance C sequestration. This review article describes examples of the emission-neutral concept already adopted by some industries, outlines strategies to promote 4p1000 and NETs, and discusses approaches to advance site-specific NETs. These techniques may include conservation agriculture, cover cropping, precision agriculture, etc., facilitated by artificial intelligence, remote sensing, and robots. Innovative methods of soil sampling as well as remote sensing and mapping of SOC stock are pertinent to promoting NETs and 4p1000. Payments to land managers and farmers for provisioning of ecosystem services through C sequestration in soil and the biosphere can advance the mission of 4p1000. Amongst strategies of encouraging industries to adopt NETs, implementation of a ‚ÄúHealthy Soil Act‚Äù at the state, national, and global level could be a step in the right direction. Market-based economic incentives to industry may be another option to promote adoption of NETs. Similar to U.S. EPA Clean Air Act of 1963 and the U.S. EPA Clean Water Act of 1972, there is a strong need to enact a Healthy Soil Act globally. An effective implementation of the trinity of Acts (air, water, and soil) at the national and global scale will accelerate the process of re-carbonization of the soil and the terrestrial biosphere while also strengthening the provisioning of essential ecosystem services. ¬© 2020 Elsevier B.V.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2020,378,,,10.1016/j.geoderma.2020.114613,,,,55444564800;,114613,,,,6.0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85088820034&doi=10.1016%2fj.geoderma.2020.114613&partnerID=40&md5=4e9b871c17f18b380040ef1fcb823b76,Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Artificial intelligence; Biospherics; Budget control; Carbon; Carbonization; Chemical contamination; Ecosystems; Food processing; Intelligent robots; Laws and legislation; Machinery; Remote sensing; Conservation agricultures; Economic incentive; Ecosystem services; Emission technology; Management practices; Nongovernmental organizations; Soil carbon sequestration; Terrestrial biosphere; Soils; carbon budget; carbon sequestration; emission control; government; industrial technology; nongovernmental organization; pollution policy; private sector; soil carbon; soil science; France; Ile de France; Paris; Ville de Paris,English,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85088820034,,,,Q1

The objective of this study was to explore the scale-dependent effects of environmental factors on SOC distribution and to predict SOC based on their scale-specific relationships using wavelet transform. The spatial data of SOC, slope, soil water content (SWC), soil bulk density (SBD), sand, silt, and Landsat 8 remote sensing reflectance (Rrs) were extracted at 330 m interval along three transects in the arable land of Taiyuan basin, China. The spatial series of SOC and environmental variables along each of three transects were separated into six detail components and one approximation representing different scales using wavelet decomposition. The specific scale of each detail component was identified by Hilbert transform. The SOC variances over the entire basin were mainly explained (54%‚Äì86%) by scales of 12.70 and 21.12 km. Compared with the relationships between SOC and environmental factors at sampling scale, their multiscale correlations were better at larger scales. The SOC estimation using wavelet reconstruction based on predicted SOC at all scale components outperformed its prediction using stepwise multiple linear regression (SMLR) based on the original sampling data. The major contributing scale to SOC prediction was 12.70 km over the entire basin. In the prediction of overall SOC, Rrs was the major predictor in the upstream and downstream portions, whereas soil texture was the major contributor in the midstream portion.

Although shifting cultivation is a dominant practice in several developing countries, there is still very limited information available on how to monitor this land-use practice for REDD+ as little is known about the areas of shifting cultivation or the net carbon balance. In this study, we propose and test a methodology to monitor the effect of the shifting cultivation on above-ground carbon stocks. We combine multiyear remote sensing information, taken from a 12-year period, with an in-depth community forest carbon stock inventory in Palo Seco Forest Reserve, western Panama. Using remote sensing, we were able to separate four forest classes expressing different forest-use intensity and time-since-intervention, which demonstrate expected trends in above-ground carbon stocks. The addition of different interventions observed over time is shown to be a good predictor, with remote sensing variables explaining 64.2% of the variation in forest carbon stocks in cultivated landscapes. Multitemporal and multispectral medium-resolution satellite imagery is shown to be adequate for tracking land-use dynamics of the agriculture-fallow cycle. The results also indicate that, over time, shifting cultivation has a transitory effect on forest carbon stocks in the study area. This is due to the rapid recovery of forest carbon stocks, which results in limited net emissions. Finally, community participation yielded important additional benefits to measuring carbon stocks, including transparency and the valorization of local knowledge for biodiversity monitoring. Our study provides important inputs regarding shifting cultivation, which should be taken into consideration when national forest monitoring systems are created, given the context of REDD+ safeguards. ¬© 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2012,18,12,,10.1111/j.1365-2486.2012.02788.x,,,,7201763661;55357812100;7005297104;,,3581.0,3595.0,,19.0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84868192386&doi=10.1111%2fj.1365-2486.2012.02788.x&partnerID=40&md5=d64b31c50893dbea11b02f8ea67f9c02,aboveground biomass; biodiversity; carbon sink; deforestation; developing world; emission control; environmental monitoring; forest ecosystem; greenhouse gas; land use change; monitoring system; quantitative analysis; remote sensing; satellite imagery; shifting cultivation; tracking; traditional agriculture; Bocas del Toro; Palo Seco Forest Reserve; Panama [Central America],English,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84868192386,,,,Q1

However, under current climatic conditions, Ireland is situated on the margin of the geographical range where Miscanthus production is economically feasible. It is therefore important to optimize the yield and other ecosystem services such as carbon sequestration delivered by the crop. A survey of commercial Miscanthus fields showed a large number of areas with no Miscanthus crop cover. These patches can potentially lead to reduced crop yields and soil carbon sequestration and have a significant negative impact on the economic viability of the crop. The aim of this research is to assess patchiness on a field scale and to analyse the impacts on crop yield and soil carbon sequestration. Analysis of aerial photography images was carried out on six commercial Miscanthus plantations in south east Ireland. The analysis showed an average of 372.5 patches per hectare, covering an average of 13.7% of the field area. Using net present value models and a financial balance approach it was shown that patchiness has a significant impact on payback time for initial investments and might reduce gross margins by more than 50%. Total and Miscanthus-derived soil organic carbon was measured in open patches and adjacent plots of high crop density showing significantly lower Miscanthus-derived carbon stocks in open patches compared to high crop-density patches (0.47Mg Cha(-1)+/- 0.42 SD and 0.91Mg Cha(-1)+/- 0.55 SD). Using geographic information system (GIS) it was shown that on a field scale Miscanthus-derived carbon stocks were reduced by 7.38%+/- 7.25 SD. However, total soil organic carbon stocks were not significantly different between open patches and high crop density plots indicating no impact on the overall carbon sequestration on a field scale over 3-4years since establishment for these Miscanthus sites.","[Zimmermann, Jesko; Jones, Michael B.] Trinity Coll Dublin, Coll Green, Sch Nat Sci, Dept Bot, Dublin 2, Ireland; [Styles, David] Bangor Univ, Sch Environm Nat Resources & Geog, Bangor LL57 2UW, Gwynedd, Wales; [Hastings, Astley] Univ Aberdeen, Inst Biol & Environm Sci, Aberdeen, Scotland; [Dauber, Jens] Thunen Inst Biodivers, D-38116 Braunschweig, Germany",,"Styles, David/0000-0003-4185-4478; Hastings, Astley/0000-0001-9863-7613; Zimmermann, Jesko/0000-0003-2143-1232","project SIMBIOSYS as part of the Science, Technology, Research and Innovation for the Environment (STRIVE) Programme - Irish Government under the National Development Plan [2007-B-CD-1-S1]","project SIMBIOSYS as part of the Science, Technology, Research and Innovation for the Environment (STRIVE) Programme - Irish Government under the National Development Plan","We thank the landowners who granted us access to their property.

This integration of agriculture and forestry is frequently seen as an option that can secure food security and co-deliver a range of environmental benefits. However, quantitative studies simultaneously integrating multiple aspects of agroforestry are rare. Focusing on four sustainability goals, namely adaptation to climate change, biodiversity conservation, climate change mitigation and rural development, this study investigated co-benefits and adverse side-effects of shaded agroforests above cocoa, coffee, oil palm, banana and citrus plantations in tropical humid West Africa. Time series of remote sensing land cover datasets were used to quantify and map recent land cover transitions in the region, and a field study in 25 agroforestry plots in Togo provided biomass carbon measurements in over 3000 trees, in addition to local farmers interviews. Estimates of theoretical agroforestry expansion and associated carbon sequestration potential in the region were compared to regional emissions from fossil fuels and deforestation. We found that about 1.6 Mha of losses in evergreen forests occurred between 1992 and 2015 (corresponding to 17% of the forest area originally present in 1992), while agricultural areas increased by 2.4 Mha (+5% relative to 1992). On average, trees in the studied agroforestry plots store 83.7 ¬± 7.0 t C/ha. We found synergies between rural development and adaptation benefits, no clear relationship between biodiversity and carbon storage, and a trade-off between high carbon stocks and crop yields. This trade-off can be minimized with an optimal management of agroforestry by using a mix of tree species that store medium carbon stocks and can enhance yields, soil fertility and climate resilience. In general, plant functional diversity, i.e. a balanced mix of shade trees, fruit trees, palms and bananas, emerged as a key feature of successful agroforestry systems. Besides, agroforestry trees co-products are reported as an additional, diversified source of income for local farmers. A large-scale deployment of agroforestry over seven countries in West Africa can sequester up to 135 Mt CO2/year over two decades, corresponding to about 166% of the carbon emissions from fossil fuels and deforestation in the region. Overall, agroforestry practices in tropical humid West Africa offer multiple-win solutions that are relevant to address major local and global environmental challenges. Increasing cooperation among local farmer communities, national authorities, and international organizations are instrumental to overcome the barriers for a future expansion of agroforestry systems in the region. ¬© 2020 The Authors",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2020,22,,,10.1016/j.gecco.2020.e00919,,,,57214722971;23468479700;,e00919,,,,33.0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85078985414&doi=10.1016%2fj.gecco.2020.e00919&partnerID=40&md5=efb98d754cf170425146710b78d389b2,,English,Final,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078985414,,,,Q1

The aims of this study were to explore temporal changes in cultivated land, soil erosion, and SOC loss and to identify the role of land use policy. The present study was conducted using the revised universal soil loss equation by integrating remote sensing images from 1980, 1990, 2000, and 2017. The study found that cultivated land areas increased from 275.11 thousand km2 in 1980, to 300.03 thousand km2 in 2000, and to 344.16 thousand km2 in 2010, and then decreased by 326.94 thousand km2 . The mean soil loss rates changed from 590.66 t¬∑km‚àí2¬∑yr‚àí1 in 1980 to 634.25 t¬∑km‚àí2¬∑yr‚àí1 in 2010, and then decreased to 495.66 t¬∑km‚àí2¬∑yr‚àí1 in 2017. Soil loss rate increased with increasing slope gradient. The changes in SOC loss rates demonstrated the same pattern as that of soil loss, with the largest loss rate of 728.27 kg¬∑km‚àí2¬∑yr‚àí1 . These changes can be explained by changed land use policy and population growth. In future land use management, reasonable implementation of soil conservation measures should be undertaken to reduce soil and SOC losses in the black soil region of northeastern China. ¬© 2021 by the author.

In this paper, MODIS remote sensing vegetation greenness from the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and evapotranspiration (ET) data for the 2000-2012 period were analyzed to understand the differences in the net primary productivity (NPP-proxy), carbon, and the evaporative flux of the major Cerrado natural and anthropic landscapes. The understanding of the carbon and evaporative fluxes of the main natural and anthropic vegetation types is of fundamental importance in studies regarding the impacts of land cover and land use changes in the regional and global climate. The seasonal dynamics of EVI and ET of the main natural and anthropic vegetation types of the Cerrado biome were analyzed using a total of 35 satellite-based samples distributed over representative Cerrado landscapes. Carbon and water fluxes were estimated for different scenarios, such as, a hypothetical unconverted Cerrado, 2002 and 2050 scenarios based on values derived from literature and on the PROBIO land cover and land use map for the Cerrado. The total growing season biomass for 2002 in the Cerrado region was estimated to be 28 gigatons of carbon and the evapotranspiration was 1336 gigatons of water. The mean estimated growing season evapotranspiration and biomass for 2002 was 576 Gt of water and 12 Gt of carbon for pasture and croplands compared to 760 Gt of water and 15 Gt of carbon for the Cerrado natural vegetation. In a modeled future scenario for the year 2050, the ET flux from natural Cerrado vegetation was 394 Gt less than in 2002 and 991 Gt less than in an unconverted scenario, with only natural vegetation, while the carbon was 8 Gt less than in 2002 and 21 Gt less than in this hypothetical pre-conversion Cerrado. On the other hand, the sum of the pasture and cropland ET flux increased by 405 Gt in 2050 relative to 2002 and the carbon by 11 Gt of carbon. Given the increasing global demand for agricultural products and the insufficient protected areas in the Cerrado (with a significant area of remaining native vegetation in privately owned lands that may be legally deforested), our analyses suggest that potential future changes to the water and carbon balances are likely to be highly significant in the severely threatened Cerrado biome. On the other hand, our results also suggest that the recovery of degraded pastures can have a positive impact on climate, due to the higher rates of carbon sequestration and water transfer to the atmosphere. ¬© 2016 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

Agricultural water and land utilization mode has a great impact on the amount of carbon emissions, and thus the aim of this work is to propose an optimal modeling approach for generating efficient agricultural water and land management alternatives and reducing carbon emission in agricultural water-energy-food nexus system. This study presents a novel approach consisting of carbon footprint lifecycle assessment method and bi-level multi-objective stochastic programming model. The proposed approach has contributions in following aspects: (1) the environmental impact of different resource allocation strategies can be measured in optimization (2) the spatial variability of spatial data (e.g., ET0 and precipitation); can be fully reflected via remote sensing information; (3) tradeoffs among two decision-making levels and their conflicting objectives under randomness of surface water availability can be addressed. The proposed approach was applied to the middle reaches of the Heihe River basin, northwest China. After solving the proposed model, the optimal water and land use alternatives under different hydrological years can be generated. Decision makers can plan agricultural production strategy according to optimization schemes, and reduce carbon emission through increasing vegetable cultivation and surface water utilization. Furthermore, the performance comparison of different models indicated that fierce conflicts exist between income fairness and economic benefits. The comprehensive evaluation value of bi-level multi-objective stochastic programming model is 0.7036, which is highest among single- and multi-objective models, showing that such model has obvious advantage in dealing with multiple decision-making levels and conflicting objectives. This approach can help decision makers of similar regions manage the agricultural production system in a more efficient and environment-friendly way. ¬© 2021 Elsevier Ltd",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021,316,,,10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.128325,,,,56341334400;57217847897;36189495000;9846776500;55736888500;,128325,,,,6.0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85110743166&doi=10.1016%2fj.jclepro.2021.128325&partnerID=40&md5=4b49730bb9f781fbe8c8e83e405a8ca5,Carbon footprint; Cultivation; Decision making; Emission control; Life cycle; Remote sensing; Stochastic models; Stochastic programming; Stochastic systems; Surface waters; Agricultural land; Agricultural water; Agricultural water management; Bi-level multi-objective stochastic programming; Carbon emissions; Land managements; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Model approach; Optimal model; Spatial data; Land use,English,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85110743166,,,,Q1

The Nile delta provides two thirds of Egypt's agriculture land, but is threatened by urban sprawl. The paper aims to quantify urban expansion over a 45 year period using 6 time points from 1972 to 2017, and its impacts on agricultural potential, soil organic carbon stocks, and implications for water use. The study used multi-temporal satellite data and remote sensing techniques (Maximum Likelihood supervised classification, and NDVI), soil sampling and analysis, data on water irrigation, and agroecological system and ecosystem services model (MicroLEIS, InVEST) to assess the effects of land use change. Urban area increased by a factor of 5, from 452 km2 in 1972 to 2644 km2 in 2017. The greatest losses occurred to the fertile Vertic Torrifluvent soils on the older delta, which lost 1734 km2. Soil organic carbon (0-75 cm depth) lost as a result of soil sealing from urbanisation rose from 25,000 to 141,000 Mg C over the 45 years. As a result of increased pressure on delta land, agriculture expanded into the higher desert areas outside the delta, on marginal land sustained by intensive fertiliser use and irrigation, which in turn puts pressure on water use. Therefore, rapid urban expansion has resulted in a loss of soil carbon and a shift in agriculture from fertile soils to marginal soils, requiring more capital inputs, which is ultimately less sustainable. Modelling suggested that soil management improvement could make better use of fertile soils within the Delta currently affected by high salinity and poor drainage. Future planning should encourage urban expansion on the less fertile soils outside of the delta, while improving suitability of existing agricultural land and minimising land degradation within the delta.","[Abd-Elmabod, Sameh K.; Zhang, Zhenhua] Jiangsu Acad Agr Sci, Inst Agr Resources & Environm, Nanjing 210014, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Abd-Elmabod, Sameh K.; Ali, Ramadan R.] Natl Res Ctr, Soils & Water Use Dept, Cairo 12622, Egypt; [Abd-Elmabod, Sameh K.; Fitch, Alice C.; Jones, Laurence] Ctr Ecol & Hydrol CEH Bangor, Environm Ctr Wales, Deiniol Rd, Bangor LL57 2UW, Gwynedd, Wales",,"Jones, Laurence/0000-0002-4379-9006; Ali, Rafat/0000-0002-2483-2907; ABD-ELMABOD, SAMEH KOTB/0000-0003-1697-7564; Fitch, Alice/0000-0002-6260-8957","British Council (Newton Fund, UK); Science and Technology Development Fund (STDF, Egypt) [27663]; Talented Young Scientist Program (TYSP), China Science and Technology Exchange Center","British Council (Newton Fund, UK); Science and Technology Development Fund (STDF, Egypt)(Science and Technology Development Fund (STDF)); Talented Young Scientist Program (TYSP), China Science and Technology Exchange Center","We thank the British Council (Newton Fund, UK) and Science and Technology Development Fund (STDF, Egypt) for funding this project (ID 27663).

A key reason for this omission is the cost and uncertainty of monitoring C at the farm scale in heterogeneous smallholder landscapes. A largely overlooked alternative is to monitor C at more aggregated scales and develop C contracts with groups of land owners, community organizations or C aggregators working across entire landscapes (e.g., watersheds, communities, municipalities, etc.). In this study we use a 100-km(2) agricultural area in El Salvador to demonstrate how high-spatial resolution optical satellite imagery can be used to map aboveground woody biomass (AGWB) C at the landscape scale with very low uncertainty (95% probability of a deviation of less than 1%). Uncertainty of AGWB-C estimates remained low (<5%) for areas as small as 250 ha, despite high uncertainties at the farm and plot scale (34-99%). We estimate that CSA adoption could more than double AGWB-C stocks on agricultural lands in the study area, and that utilizing AGWB-C maps to target denuded areas could increase C gains per unit area by 46%. The potential value of C credits under a plausible adoption scenario would range from $38,270 to $354,000 yr(-1) for the study area, or about $13 to $124 ha(-1) yr(-1), depending on C prices. Considering farm sizes in smallholder landscapes rarely exceed 1-2 ha, relying solely on direct C payments to farmers may not lead to widespread CSA adoption, especially if farm-scale monitoring is required. Instead, landscape-scale approaches to C contracting, supported by satellite-based monitoring methods such as ours, could be a key strategy to reduce costs and uncertainty of C monitoring in heterogeneous smallholder landscapes, thereby incentivizing more widespread CSA adoption.

Using Landsat data to characterize cropland albedos in Canada's three prairie soil zones, this study estimates the atmospheric carbon equivalent drawdown of albedo radiative forcing for three management practices: 1) moving from conventional tillage to no-till, 2) eliminating summer fallow in crop rotations, and 3) growing crops with higher albedos. In a 50-year time horizon, conversion from conventional tillage to no-till results in a total equivalent atmospheric CO2 (CO2-eq) drawdown of 1.0-1.5 kg m(-2), and conversion from summer fallow to crops results in CO2-eq drawdown of 1.1-2.4 kg m(-2). Conversion of summer fallow to crops results in different magnitudes of CO2-eq drawdown depending on specific crops. Lentils, peas, and canola have relatively higher albedo than that of spring wheat and flax; hence, a larger magnitude of CO2-eq drawdown results when they replace summer fallow in the rotation. For the management changes from 1990 to 2019 for the whole Canadian Prairies, albedo changes induced a CO2-eq drawdown of about 179.3 +/- 20.9 Tg due to increased area of no-till, and 101.6 +/- 9.5 Tg due to reduced area under fallow. The study shows that the magnitudes of CO2-eq drawdown due to albedo change are comparable to that due to soil carbon sequestration. Therefore, it is important to account for cropland albedo changes in assessing the potential of agricultural management practices to mitigate climate change.","[Liu, Jiangui; Desjardins, Raymond L.; Worth, Devon E.; Qian, Budong; Shang, Jiali] Agr & Agri Food Canada, Ottawa Res & Dev Ctr, Ottawa, ON K1A 0C6, Canada; [Wang, Shusen] Nat Resources Canada, Canada Ctr Remote Sensing, Ottawa, ON K1A 0E6, Canada",,"Liu, Jiangui/0000-0003-3560-4034",,,,,72.0,1.0,1.0,ACADEMIC PRESS LTD- ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,0301-4797,1095-8630,,J ENVIRON MANAGE,J.

Although surface roughness, vegetation and soil texture have been established as sources of variability in passive microwave interpretation, soil organic carbon (SOC) has not typically been considered as a factor that affects SWC estimation during field sampling campaigns. SOC was observed along with soil texture and bulk density during the Soil Moisture Active Passive Validation Experiment in 2012 (SMAPVEX12), the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite algorithm development field sampling campaign held June 6 to July 19 in Southern Manitoba, Canada. Aerial measurements from the PALS (Passive Active L-band System) instrument were recorded over agricultural fields and forest areas from aircraft while SWC was measured simultaneously on the ground with resistance probes on 17 sampling dates. Additionally, fields were sampled for surface roughness, vegetation growth and water content, soil and vegetation temperature and soil physical characteristics. A soil core was collected on each field each sampling time to assess bulk density, soil particle size and SOC. SOC accounted for more variability in the anomalies between PALS and ground sampled SWC than sand, clay or bulk density, although all soil variables explained significant variability. With analysis by partial least squares multiple regression over 11 sampling dates and 39 fields where both ground and PALS data were well represented, only SOC contributed significantly to the regression of SWC beyond the variance all soil variables had in common. The significance of SOC in the relative SWC anomalies was highest in very wet and very dry conditions and in loam soil over all sampling dates, while bulk density was more significant in sand soils. This analysis suggests SOC is a simple variable that incorporates multiple aspects of soil hydrology and may improve the algorithms for remotely sensing estimation of SWC in various landscapes.

However, ES studies at local scales that address the subject from the perspective of farm property are rare. In this paper, we performed the quantification, valuation, and mapping of carbon storage and sequestration of observed (2007‚Äì2017) and future LULC (2027) sustainable scenarios at a cattle ranch in Serra da Mantiqueira, in Southeastern Brazil. The aim was to understand how different LULC changes affect the provision of ES and contribute to economic opportunities to the farming sector. Under a GIS-approach, we used remote sensing techniques for LULC mapping, Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST) for scenario building and carbon assessment, as well as the Sis software suite for forest growth and production simulation. All scenarios contributed to increasing carbon storage and sequestration and provided profitable economic opportunities. The introduction of Eucalyptus trees in livestock and agricultural production systems is an alternative for diversification and income increase, contributing to the balance of greenhouse gases (GHG) from livestock activity and adding value to production. These results are useful to support land use planning and management for both environmental conservation policies and sustainable farming production. ¬© 2021 Elsevier Ltd",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021,111,,,10.1016/j.landusepol.2021.105788,,,,57328177900;56221630400;,105788,,,,2.0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85118795433&doi=10.1016%2fj.landusepol.2021.105788&partnerID=40&md5=0e960c3666e5701ea2aa3802ae6086d2,alternative agriculture; carbon storage; ecosystem service; GIS; land cover; land use planning; mapping method; profitability; remote sensing; software; Brazil; Serra da Mantiqueira; Eucalyptus,English,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85118795433,,,,Q1

The anthropogenic activities such as burning fossil fuel, power generation, agriculture, industry, polluting water bodies and urban activities are responsible for increasing GHG footprint of which 72% constitute CO2. GHG footprint needs to be in balance with sequestration of carbon to sustain ecosystem functions. Forests are the major carbon sinks (about 45%) that aid in mitigating global warming. The current research focusses on the carbon budgeting through quantification of emissions and sinks in the forest ecosystems and changes in climatic conditions of Western Ghats. This would help in evolving appropriate mitigation strategies toward sustainable management of forests and mitigate impacts of global warming. The land-use land-cover (LULC) dynamics are the prime driver of climate change due to the loss of carbon sequestration potential as well as emissions. The Western Ghats are one among 36 global biodiversity hotspots and forests in this region sequester atmospheric carbon, which aid in moderating the global climate and sustaining water to ensure water and food security in the peninsular India. Assessment of LULC dynamics using temporal remote sensing data shows the decline of evergreen forest by 5% with an increase in agriculture, plantations and built-up area. The interior or intact forests have declined by 10%, and they are now confined to protected areas. The simulation of likely changes indicates that¬†the region will have only 10% evergreen cover and 17% agriculture, 40% plantations and 5% built-up. Quantification of carbon reveals that the WG forest ecosystem holds 1.23 MGg (million gigagrams or Gt) in vegetation and soils. The annual incremental carbon is about 37,507.3¬†Gg, (or 37.5 million tons, Mt) and the highest in the forests of Karnataka part of WG. Simulation of the likely changes in carbon content indicates the loss of 0.23 MGg (2018‚Äì2031) carbon sequestration potential under business as usual scenario. The conservation scenario depicts an increase in carbon sequestration potential of WG forests with the protection. Sequestered carbon in WG is about INR 100 billion ($1.4 billion) at carbon trading of INR 2142 ($30) per tonne. Large-scale land-cover changes leading to deforestation has contributed to an increase in mean temperature by 0.5¬∞C and decline in rainy days, which necessitates evolving prudent landscape management strategies involving all stakeholders for conservation of ecologically fragile WG. This will enhance the ability of forests to sequester atmospheric carbon and climate moderation, with the sustenance of ecosystem goods and services. ¬© 2019, International Association for Mathematical Geosciences.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2020,29,4,,10.1007/s11053-019-09588-0,,,,6603937958;57195329923;,,2753.0,2771.0,,14.0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85075198502&doi=10.1007%2fs11053-019-09588-0&partnerID=40&md5=ddea36f433df19dab725193ae65ddc21,,English,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85075198502,,,,Q1

The conventional way to obtain AGB is to use destructive sampling methods that require manual harvesting of crops, weighing, and recording, which makes large-area, long-term measurements challenging and time consuming. However, with the diversity of platforms and sensors and the improvements in spatial and spectral resolution, remote sensing is now regarded as the best technical means for monitoring and estimating AGB over large areas.ResultsIn this study, we used structural and spectral information provided by remote sensing from an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) in combination with machine learning to estimate maize biomass. Of the 14 predictor variables, six were selected to create a model by using a recursive feature elimination algorithm. Four machine-learning regression algorithms (multiple linear regression, support vector machine, artificial neural network, and random forest) were evaluated and compared to create a suitable model, following which we tested whether the two sampling methods influence the training model. To estimate the AGB of maize, we propose an improved method for extracting plant height from UAV images and a volumetric indicator (i.e., BIOVP). The results show that (1) the random forest model gave the most balanced results, with low error and a high ratio of the explained variance for both the training set and the test set. (2) BIOVP can retain the largest strength effect on the AGB estimate in four different machine learning models by using importance analysis of predictors. (3) Comparing the plant heights calculated by the three methods with manual ground-based measurements shows that the proposed method increased the ratio of the explained variance and reduced errors.ConclusionsThese results lead us to conclude that the combination of machine learning with UAV remote sensing is a promising alternative for estimating AGB. This work suggests that structural and spectral information can be considered simultaneously rather than separately when estimating biophysical crop parameters.","[Han, Liang; Yang, Guijun; Yang, Hao; Li, Zhenhai; Yang, Xiaodong] Beijing Res Ctr Informat Technol Agr, Key Lab Quantitat Remote Sensing Agr, Minist Agr, Beijing 100097, Peoples R China; [Han, Liang] Shanxi Datong Univ, Coll Architecture & Geomat Engn, Datong 037003, Peoples R China; [Yang, Guijun; Xu, Bo; Yang, Hao; Feng, Haikuan; Li, Zhenhai; Yang, Xiaodong] Natl Engn Res Ctr Informat Technol Agr, Beijing 100097, Peoples R China; [Dai, Huayang] China Univ Min & Technol Beijing, Coll Geosci & Surveying Engn, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China",,"Li, Zhenhai/0000-0001-9878-3274; Feng, Haikuan/0000-0003-3312-6200; Yang, Guijun/0000-0002-6425-8321; Yang, Hao/0000-0001-8506-7295",National Key Research and Development Program of China [2016YFD0300602]; Natural Science Foundation of China [61661136003]; Beijing Natural Science Foundation [6182011]; Special Funds for Technology innovation capacity building - Beijing Academy of Agriculture and Forestry Sciences [KJCX20170423]; STFC [ST/N006801/1] Funding Source: UKRI,National Key Research and Development Program of China; Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Beijing Natural Science Foundation(Beijing Natural Science Foundation); Special Funds for Technology innovation capacity building - Beijing Academy of Agriculture and Forestry Sciences; STFC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Science & Technology Facilities Council (STFC)),"This study was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2016YFD0300602), the Natural Science Foundation of China (61661136003), the Beijing Natural Science Foundation (6182011), the Special Funds for Technology innovation capacity building sponsored by the Beijing Academy of Agriculture and Forestry Sciences (KJCX20170423).",,73.0,134.0,145.0,BMC,,1746-4811,,PLANT METHODS,Plant Methods,4-Feb,2019,15,,10,10.1186/s13007-019-0394-z,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13007-019-0394-z,,19.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Q1

The accuracy of GPS receivers for the territory of Russia is approximately 3-10m. The aim of the study was to estimate the impact of sampling positioning accuracy on the relationship between soil organic carbon content and the infrared channel of the WorldView-2 satellite image and for mapping soil organic carbon contents in an agricultural field in the territory of the Bryansk Opolje (Russia). Intensive sampling of the topsoil took place. The positional accuracy was also measured and used to perturb the locations of the samples. The data were used to study: (i) the relationships between soil organic carbon and infrared reflectance, (ii) the variation in soil organic carbon through five different interpolation techniques, and (iii) the fraction of the fields with low soil organic matter contents. The study showed that the positional inaccuracies can have an important impact. The standardized methods to estimate the positional accuracy, perturb the locations and evaluate its impact seems to be an easy way to explore the quality of data.","[Samsonova, V. P.; Meshalkina, J.

Sensor data fusion can potentially overcome this inability of a single sensor and can best extract useful and complementary information from multiple sensors or sources. In this study, a data fusion was performed of a Vis-NIR spectrometer and an EM38 sensor for multiple soil properties. Stepwise multiple linear regression (SMLR), partial least squares regression (PLSR) and principal components analysis combined with stepwise multiple linear regression (PCA + SMLR) methods were used in three different fields. Soil properties investigated for data fusion included soil texture (clay, silt and sand), EC, pH, total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN) and carbon to nitrogen ratio (CN). It was found that soil property models based on fusion methods significantly improved the accuracy of predictions of soil properties measureable by both sensors, such as clay, silt, sand, EC and pH from those based on either of the individual sensors. The accuracy of predictions of TOC, TN and CN was also improved in some cases, but was not consistent in all fields. Among data fusion methods, PLSR outperformed both SMLR and PCA + SMLR methods because it proved to have a better ability to deal with the multi-collinearity among the predictor variables of both sensors. The best data fusion results were found in a clayey field and the worst in a sandy field. It is concluded that sensor data fusion can enhance the quality of soil sensing in precision agriculture once a proper set of sensors has been selected for fusion to estimate desired soil properties. More efficient statistical data analysis methods are needed to handle a large volume of data effectively from multiple sensors for sensor data fusion.","[Mahmood, Hafiz S.; Hoogmoed, Willem B.; van Henten, Eldert J.] Wageningen Univ, Farm Technol Grp, NL-6700 AH Wageningen, Netherlands",,"van Henten, Eldert J./0000-0002-1623-9855","Higher Education Commission (HEC), Pakistan","Higher Education Commission (HEC), Pakistan(Higher Education Commission of Pakistan)","We acknowledge Higher Education Commission (HEC), Pakistan, for supporting this research and providing a PhD scholarship under the Overseas Scholarship Programme, Phase-II, Batch-I.",,27.0,41.0,41.0,SPRINGER,1385-2256,1573-1618,,PRECIS AGRIC,Precis.

Since variability of SOC is mainly attributed to biophysical land surface variables, integrating a compressive set of such indices may support the pursuit of an optimum set of predictor variables. Therefore, this study was aimed at predicting the spatial distribution of SOC in relation to remotely sensed variables and other covariates. Hence, the land surface variables were combined from remote sensing, topographic, and soil spectral sources. Moreover, the most influential variables for prediction were selected using the random forest (RF) and classification and regression tree (CART). The results indicated that the RF model has good prediction performance with corresponding R2 and root-mean-square error (RMSE) values of 0.96 and 0.91 mg¬∑g‚àí1, respectively. The distribution of SOC content showed variability across landforms (CV = 78.67%), land use (CV = 93%), and lithology (CV = 64.67%). Forestland had the highest SOC (13.60 mg¬∑g‚àí1) followed by agriculture (10.43 mg¬∑g‚àí1), urban (9.74 mg¬∑g‚àí1), and water body (4.55 mg¬∑g‚àí1) land uses. Furthermore, soils developed in bauxite and laterite lithology had the highest SOC content (14.69 mg¬∑g‚àí1). The SOC content was remarkably lower in soils developed in sandstones; however, the values obtained in soils from the rest of the lithologies could not be significantly differentiated. The mean SOC concentration was 11.70 mg¬∑g‚àí1, where the majority of soils in the study area were classified as highly humus and extremely humus. The soils with the highest SOC content (extremely humus) were distributed in the mountainous regions of the study area. The biophysical land surface indices, brightness removed vegetation indices, topographic indices, and soil spectral bands were the most influential predictors of SOC in the study area. The spatial variability of SOC may be influenced by landform, land use, and lithology of the study area. Remotely sensed predictors including land moisture, land surface temperature, and built-up indices added valuable information for the prediction of SOC. Hence, the land surface indices may provide new insights into SOC modeling in complex landscapes of warm subtropical urban regions. ¬© 2021 by the authors.

Revegetation with halophytic shrub species such as Atriplex nummularia for carbon mitigation may be a viable option but to generate carbon credits ongoing monitoring and verification is required. This study investigated the utility of high-resolution airborne images (Digital Multi Spectral Imagery (DMSI)) obtained in two seasons to estimate carbon stocks at the plant- and stand-scale. Pixel-scale vegetation indices, sub-pixel fractional green vegetation cover for individual plants, and estimates of the fractional coverage of the grazing plants within entire plots, were extracted from the high-resolution images. Carbon stocks were correlated with both canopy coverage (R2: 0.76-0.89) and spectral-based vegetation indices (R2: 0.77-0.89) with or without the use of the near-infrared spectral band. Indices derived from the dry season image showed a stronger correlation with field measurements of carbon than those derived from the green season image. These results show that in semi-arid environments it is better to estimate saltbush biomass with remote sensing data in the dry season to exclude the effect of pasture, even without the refinement provided by a vegetation classification. The approach of using canopy cover to refine estimates of carbon yield has broader application in shrublands and woodlands. ¬© 2017 by the authors.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2017,9,6,,10.3390/rs9060545,,,,55497289900;7401530212;6506264079;55782839600;21735622100;7004909808;56543429900;35783262300;,545,,,,12.0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85020275209&doi=10.3390%2frs9060545&partnerID=40&md5=dfa32dbf41e4aa8f304409ceb940f1dd,Agriculture; Drought; Forestry; Pixels; Remote sensing; Revegetation; Soil conservation; Spectroscopy; Timing circuits; Above ground biomass; Atriplex nummularia; Carbon inventories; Carbon mitigation; Forage crops; Vegetation index; Vegetation,English,Final,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020275209,,,,Q1

Digital soil mapping plays an important role in efficiently obtaining the spatial distribution of SOC, which contributes to precision agriculture. However, traditional soil-forming factors (i.e., terrain or climatic factors) have weak variability in low-relief areas, such as plains, and cannot reflect the spatial variation of soil attributes. Meanwhile, vegetation cover hinders the acquisition of the direct information of farmland soil. Thus, useful environmental variables should be utilized for SOC prediction and the digital mapping of such areas. SOC has an important effect on crop growth status, and remote sensing data can record the apparent spectral characteristics of crops. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) is an important index reflecting crop growth and biomass. This study used NDVI time series data rather than traditional soil-forming factors to map SOC. Honghu City, located in the middle of the Jianghan Plain, was selected as the study region, and the NDVI time series data extracted from Landsat 8 were used as the auxiliary variables. SOC maps were estimated through stepwise linear regression (SLR), partial least squares regression (PLSR), support vector machine (SVM), and artificial neural network (ANN). Ordinary kriging (OK) was used as the reference model, while root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) and coefficient of determination of prediction (R2 P) were used to evaluate the model performance. Results showed that SOC had a significant positive correlation in July and August (0.17, 0.29) and a significant negative correlation in January, April, and December (-0.23, -0.27, and -0.23) with NDVI time series data. The best model for SOC prediction was generated by ANN, with the lowest RMSEP of 3.718 and highest R2 P of 0.391, followed by SVM (RMSEP = 3.753, R2 P = 0.361) and PLSR (RMSEP = 4.087, R2 P = 0.283). The SLR model was the worst model, with the lowest R2 P of 0.281 and highest RMSEP of 3.930. ANN and SVM were better than OK (RMSEP = 3.727, R2 P = 0.372), whereas PLSR and SLR were worse than OK. Moreover, the prediction results using single-data NDVI or short time series NDVI showed low accuracy. The effect of the terrain factor on SOC prediction represented unsatisfactory results. All these results indicated that the NDVI time series data can be used for SOC mapping in plain areas and that theANNmodel can maximally extract additional associated information between NDVI time series data and SOC. This study presented an effective method to overcome the selection of auxiliary variables for digital soil mapping in plain areas when the soil was covered with vegetation. This finding indicated that the time series characteristics of NDVI were conducive for predicting SOC in plains. ¬© 2019 by the authors.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2019,11,14,,10.3390/rs11141683,,,,57210822298;50661250400;36571499900;55349704100;57204914192;57207857692;57192172966;8365963700;,1683,,,,39.0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85071574866&doi=10.3390%2frs11141683&partnerID=40&md5=ec70a92bbd135ffa420d6d45b8fd18c2,Crops; Data mining; Forecasting; Forestry; Least squares approximations; Mapping; Mean square error; Neural networks; Organic carbon; Remote sensing; Soil surveys; Support vector machines; Time series; Vegetation; Digital soil mappings; Machine learning methods; NDVI time series; Prediction model; Soil organic carbon; Soils,English,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071574866,,,,Q1

This paper presents results from the SolumScire project, focusing on the prediction of the spatial distribution of soil zones and topsoil properties, such as pH, soil organic matter (SOM) and clay content in agricultural fields through random forest algorithms. For this purpose, samples from 120 fields were investigated. The zoning and soil property prediction has an accuracy greater than 90%. This is supported by a high agreement of the derived zones with farmer's observations. The trained models revealed a prediction accuracy of 94%, 89% and 96% for pH, SOM and clay content, respectively. The obtained models for soil properties can support precision field management, the improvement of soil sampling and fertilization strategies, and eventually the management of soil properties such as SOM. ¬© 2020, by the authors.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2020,12,7,,10.3390/rs12071116,,,,48161792800;57225812573;57225395020;6505641135;,1116,,,,10.0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85084264499&doi=10.3390%2frs12071116&partnerID=40&md5=dfc853f6ca681295e7863eded416f141,Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Decision trees; Environmental impact; Forecasting; Remote sensing; Soils; Zoning; Agricultural fields; Agricultural system; Field management; Prediction accuracy; Random forest algorithm; Soil carbon sequestration; Soil organic matters; Spatial and temporal resolutions; Soil surveys,English,Final,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084264499,,,,Q1

Contemporary Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) carrying low-cost and lightweight multispectral sensors provide high spatial resolution imagery (<10 cm). These capabilities allow integrate of UAS-derived soil data and maps into digitalized workflows for sustainable agriculture. However, the common situation of scarce soil data at field scale might be an obstacle for accurate digital soil mapping. In our case study we tested a fixed-wing UAS equipped with visible and near infrared (VIS-NIR) sensors to estimate topsoil SOC distribution at two fields under the constraint of limited sampling points, which were selected by pedological knowledge. They represent all releva nt soil types along an erosion-deposition gradient; hence, the full feature space in terms of topsoils‚Äô SOC status. We included the Topographic Position Index (TPI) as a co-variate for SOC prediction. Our study was performed in a soil landscape of hummocky ground moraines, which represent a significant of global arable land. Herein, small scale soil variability is mainly driven by tillage erosion which, in turn, is strongly dependent on topography. Relationships between SOC, TPI and spectral information were tested by Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) using: (i) single field data (local approach) and (ii) data from both fields (pooled approach). The highest prediction performance determined by a leave-one-out-cross-validation (LOOCV) was obtained for the models using the reflectance at 570 nm in conjunction with the TPI as explanatory variables for the local approach (coefficient of determination (R¬≤) = 0.91; root mean square error (RMSE) = 0.11% and R¬≤ = 0.48; RMSE = 0.33, respectively). The local MLR models developed with both reflectance and TPI using values from all points showed high correlations and low prediction errors for SOC content (R¬≤ = 0.88, RMSE = 0.07%; R¬≤ = 0.79, RMSE = 0.06%, respectively). The comparison with an enlarged dataset consisting of all points from both fields (pooled approach) showed no improvement of the prediction accuracy but yielded decreased prediction errors. Lastly, the local MLR models were applied to the data of the respective other field to evaluate the cross-field prediction ability. The spatial SOC pattern generally remains unaffected on both fields; differences, however, occur concerning the predicted SOC level. Our results indicate a high potential of the combination of UAS-based remote sensing and environmental covariates, such as terrain attributes, for the prediction of topsoil SOC content at the field scale. The temporal flexibility of UAS offer the opportunity to optimize flight conditions including weather and soil surface status (plant cover or residuals, moisture and roughness) which, otherwise, might obscure the relationship between spectral data and SOC content. Pedologically targeted se-lection of soil samples for model development appears to be the key for an efficient and effective prediction even with a small dataset. ¬© 2021 by the authors.

Hence, there is a strong demand for mapping and monitoring critical soil properties and in particular soil organic carbon (SOC). Pilot studies have demonstrated the potential for remote sensing techniques for SOC mapping in croplands. It has, however, been shown that the assessment of SOC may be hampered by the condition of the soil surface. While growing vegetation can be readily detected by means of the well-known Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), the distinction between bare soil and crop residues is expressed in the shortwave infrared region (SWIR), which is only covered by two broad bands in Landsat or Sentinel-2 imagery. Here we tested the effect of thresholds for the Cellulose Absorption Index (CAI), on the performance of SOC prediction models for cropland soils. Airborne Prism Experiment (APEX) hyperspectral images covering an area of 240 km2 in the Belgian Loam Belt were used together with a local soil dataset. We used the partial least square regression (PLSR) model to estimate the SOC content based on 104 georeferenced calibration samples (NDVI &lt; 0.26), firstly without setting a CAI threshold, and obtained a satisfactory result (coefficient of determination (R2) = 0.49, Ratio of Performance to Deviation (RPD) = 1.4 and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) = 2.13 g kgC-1 for cross-validation). However, a cross comparison of the estimated SOC values to grid-based measurements of SOC content within three fields revealed a systematic overestimation for fields with high residue cover. We then tested different CAI thresholds in order to mask pixels with high residue cover. The best model was obtained for a CAI threshold of 0.75 (R2 = 0.59, RPD = 1.5 and RMSE = 1.75 g kgC-1 for cross-validation). These results reveal that the purity of the pixels needs to be assessed aforehand in order to produce reliable SOC maps. The Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR2) index based on the SWIR bands of the MSI Sentinel 2 sensor extracted from images collected nine days before the APEX flight campaign correlates well with the CAI index of the APEX imagery. However, the NBR2 index calculated from Sentinel 2 images under moist conditions is poorly correlated with residue cover. This can be explained by the sensitivity of the NBR2 index to both soil moisture and residues. ¬© 2020 by the authors.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2020,12,12,,10.3390/rs12121913,,,,57217279893;57194699594;57217281555;56888870100;,1913,,,,14.0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85086997121&doi=10.3390%2frs12121913&partnerID=40&md5=8035f03dfe75d8bf0898de5e9ce0dc8a,Agricultural robots; Agricultural wastes; Crops; Infrared radiation; Mapping; Mean square error; Organic carbon; Pixels; Soil moisture; Spectroscopy; Vegetation; Airborne prism experiments; Cellulose absorption indices; Coefficient of determination; Normalized difference vegetation index; Partial least square regression; Remote sensing techniques; Root mean square errors; Soil organic carbon; Remote sensing; Farm Crops; Infrared Radiation; Mapping; Plants; Remote Sensing; Spectroscopy,English,Final,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086997121,,,,Q1

The international initiative ""4 per 1000"" aims at implementing practical actions on increasing soil carbon storage in soils under agriculture. This requires a fundamental understanding of the soil carbon changes across the globe. Several studies have suggested that the global soil organic carbon stocks (SOCS) have decreased due to global warming and land cover change, while others reported SOCS may increase under climate change and improved soil management. To better understand how a changing climate, land cover, and agricultural activities influence SOCS across large extents and long periods, the spatial and temporal variations of SOCS were estimated using a modified space-for-time substitution method over a 150-year period in the state of Wisconsin, USA. We used legacy soil datasets and environmental factors collected and estimated at different times across the state (169,639 km2) coupled with a machine-learning algorithm. The legacy soil datasets were collected from 1980 to 2002 from 550 soil profiles and harmonized to 0.30 m depth. The environmental factors consisted of 100-m soil property maps, 1-km annual temperature and precipitation maps, 250-m remote-sensing (i.e., Landsat)-derived yearly land cover maps and a 30-m digital elevation model. The model performance was moderate but can provide insights on understanding the impacts of different factors on SOCS changes across a large spatial and temporal extent. SOCS at the 0-0.30 m decreased at a rate of 0.1 ton ha-1 year-1 between 1850 and 1938 and increased at 0.2 ton ha-1 year-1 between 1980 and 2002. The spatial variation in SOCS at 0-0.30 m was mainly affected by land cover and soil types with the largest SOCS found in forest and wetland and Spodosols. The loss between 1850 and 1980 was most likely due to land cover change while the increase between 1980 and 2002 was due to best soil management practices (e.g., decreased erosion, reduced tillage, crop rotation and use of legume and cover crops). ¬© 2019 by the authors.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2019,11,12,,10.3390/rs11121504,,,,55949162400;7003293119;57203831303;,1504,,,,15.0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85068193483&doi=10.3390%2frs11121504&partnerID=40&md5=e1427669db19fb8e31030c766d80a364,Agronomy; Climate change; Crops; Forestry; Global warming; Land use; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Organic carbon; Remote sensing; 4 per 1000; Best management practices; Carbon pool; Carbon sink; Industrial revolutions; Soils,English,Final,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068193483,,,,Q1

These data enable monitoring of a wide variety of soil properties but pose important methodological challenges. Highly correlated hyperspectral spectral bands can affect the prediction and accuracy as well as the interpretability of the retrieval model. Therefore, the spectral dimension needs to be reduced through a selection of specific spectral bands or regions that are most helpful to describing SOC. This study evaluates the efficiency of visible near-infrared (VNIR) and shortwave near-infrared (SWIR) hyperspectral data to identify the most informative hyperspectral bands responding to SOC content in agricultural soils. Soil samples (111) were collected over an agricultural field in southern Ontario, Canada and analyzed against two hyperspectral datasets: An airborne Nano-Hyperspec imaging sensor with 270 bands (400-1000 nm) and a laboratory hyperspectral dataset (ASD FieldSpec 3) along the 1000-2500 nm range (NIR-SWIR). In parallel, a multimethod modeling approach consisting of random forest, support vector machine, and partial least squares regression models was used to conduct band selections and to assess the validity of the selected bands. The multimethod model resulted in a selection of optimal band or regions over the VNIR and SWIR sensitive to SOC and potentially for mapping. The bands that achieved the highest respective importance values were 711-715, 727, 986-998, and 433-435 nm regions (VNIR); and 2365-2373, 2481-2500, and 2198-2206 nm (NIR-SWIR). Some of these bands are in agreement with the absorption features of SOC reported in the literature, whereas others have not been reported before. Ultimately, the selection of optimal band and regions is of importance for quantification of agricultural SOC and would provide a new framework for creating optimized SOC-specific sensors. ¬© 2019 by the authors.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2019,11,11,,10.3390/rs11111298,,,,47261329700;57211903687;7004239094;24773098100;57188867655;57209329653;56659285100;8635513600;7501381549;,1298,,,,17.0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85067419006&doi=10.3390%2frs11111298&partnerID=40&md5=5aafeecf0dd9330375879d8f85b7e747,Agriculture; Decision trees; Feature extraction; Infrared devices; Infrared radiation; Least squares approximations; Monitoring; Organic carbon; Regression analysis; Remote sensing; Soils; Spectroscopy; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Agricultural soils; Airborne hyperspectral imaging; HyperSpectral; Imaging spectroscopy; Model approach; Hyperspectral imaging,English,Final,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067419006,,,,Q1

Remotely sensing optical and radar data can help to map crop types and to estimate biophysical parameters, especially with the availability of an unprecedented amount of free Sentinel data within the Copernicus programme. These datasets, whose continuity is guaranteed up to decades, offer a unique opportunity to monitor crops systematically every 5 to 10 days. Before developing operational monitoring methods, it is important to understand the temporal variations of the remote sensing signal of different crop types in a given region. In this study, we analyse the temporal trajectory of remote sensing data for a variety of winter and summer crops that are widely cultivated in the world (wheat, rapeseed, maize, soybean and sunflower). The test region is in southwest France, where Sentinel-1 data have been acquired since 2014. Because Sentinel -2 data were not available for this study, optical satellites similar to Sentinel-2 are used, mainly to derive NDVI, for a comparison between the temporal behaviors with radar data. The SAR backscatter and NDVI temporal profiles of fields with varied management practices and environmental conditions are interpreted physically. Key findings from this analysis, leading to possible applications of Sentinel-1 data, with or without the conjunction of Sentinel-2, are then described.

However, it is not clear which is the optimal (e.g. coarsest possible) spatial resolution to capture those fluxes accurately. Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) can address this by collecting very high spatial resolution ( < 1 m, VHR) imagery. The objective of this study is to model ET and GPP dynamics using VHR optical and thermal imagery and quantify the influence of the spatial heterogeneity in the flux simulations and validations. The study was conducted at a deciduous willow bioenergy eddy covariance (EC) flux site in Denmark. Flight campaigns were conducted during the growing seasons of 2016 and 2017 with a hexacopter equipped with RGB, multispectral and thermal infrared cameras. A 'top-down' modeling approach consisting of the Priestley-Taylor Jet Propulsion Laboratory model and a light use efficiency model sharing the same canopy biophysical constraints was used to estimate ET and GPP. Model outputs were benchmarked by EC flux observations with the source weighted footprint. Our results indicate that our model can well estimate the instantaneous net radiation, ET, GPP, evaporative fraction, light use efficiency and water use efficiency with root-mean-square deviations (RMSD) of 31.6 W.m(-2), 41.2 W.m(-2), 3.12 mu mol.C.m(-2).s(-1), 0.08, 0.16 g.C.MJ(-1) and 0.35 g.C.kg(-1), respectively. Further, it is found that using a footprint model to sample different areas of VHR imagery can be a tool to provide better diurnal estimates to benchmark with EC data. Moreover, these VHR maps (0.3 m) allowed us to quantify metrics of spatial heterogeneity by using semivariogram analysis and by aggregating model inputs into different spatial resolutions. For instance, we find that in this site, the aggregation of simulated GPP using the source weighted mean of the EC footprint was about 30% lower in RMSD than using the arithmetic mean of the footprint. This demonstrates the accuracy of the modeled VHR spatial patterns. Nevertheless, we also find that imagery resolution consistent with the canopy size (around 1.5 m in our study) is sufficient to capture the spatial heterogeneity of the fluxes as transpiration and canopy assimilation of CO2 are processes regulated at the tree crown level. Our results highlight the importance of considering the land surface heterogeneity for flux modeling and the source contribution within the EC footprint for model benchmarking at appropriate spatial resolutions.","[Wang, Sheng; Garcia, Monica; Bauer-Gottwein, Peter; Bandini, Filippo; Paz, Veronica Sobejano; Ibrom, Andreas] Tech Univ Denmark, Dept Environm Engn, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark; [Jakobsen, Jakob] Tech Univ Denmark, Natl Space Inst, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark; [Zarco-Tejada, Pablo J.] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Sch Engn, Dept Infrastruct Engn, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Zarco-Tejada, Pablo J.] Univ Melbourne, Fac Vet & Agr Sci, Sch Agr & Food, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Zarco-Tejada, Pablo J.] CSIC, IAS, Cordoba, Spain; [Garcia, Monica] Columbia Univ, Earth Inst, Int Res Inst Climate & Soc, Palisades, NY USA",,"bandini, filippo/0000-0002-8470-2493; Wang, Sheng/0000-0003-3385-3109; Garcia, Monica/0000-0002-4587-8920; Zarco-Tejada, Pablo J./0000-0003-1433-6165; Bauer-Gottwein, Peter/0000-0002-9861-4240; Sobejano Paz, Veronica/0000-0002-0493-798X; Garcia, Monica/0000-0002-3814-2536",European Union (EU); Innovation Fund Denmark (IFD); Smart UAV project [125-2013-5]; Department of Environmental Engineering at DTU,European Union (EU)(CGIAREuropean Commission); Innovation Fund Denmark (IFD); Smart UAV project; Department of Environmental Engineering at DTU,"The authors would like to thank the European Union (EU) and Innovation Fund Denmark (IFD) for funding, in the frame of the collaborative international consortium AgWIT financed under the ERA NET Co-fund Water Works 2015 Call.

The determination of soil attributes to achieve the best decision making on land use planning is crucial. The use of remote sensing (satellite images) can improve understanding of the surface, since it collects a spectral reflectance fingerprint related to soil properties. However, methodologies still gather spatially fragmented information on bare soil in a single image; thus, there is still room to improve information as a continuous surface. This work has the purpose of developing a procedure using multi-temporal satellite image information, aiming to construct a single synthetic image which would represent soils. The work was carried out in the state of Sao Paulo, Brazil, on a site covering 14,614 km(2). The procedure, designated as Geospatial Soil Sensing System (GEOS3), is based on the following steps: a) creation of a database with Landsat 5 legacy data.; b) filtering of the database to provide images only from the dry season in the region; c) insertion of a set of rules into the system to filter other objects besides soils; d) Each bare soil occurrence for each location along the time-series was used to calculate a Temporal Synthetic Spectral Reflectance (TESS) of the soil surface; e) aggregation of all TESS composes the Synthetic Soil Image (SYSI); f) quantitative and qualitative validation of the SYSI through the correlation between laboratory and TESS, soil line assessment and the principal component analysis (PCA). GEOS3 was able to provide the best representative reflectance of soils for each band during the historical period. Thus, TESS is not the 'true' but a synthetic spectral reflectance. The canonical correlation between laboratory and satellite data reached 0.93. A value of up to 0.88 in the Pearson's correlation between laboratory and TESS was also achieved. In a single scene, only 0.5% of area was available as isolated bare soil for spatial analysis. However, SYSI reached 68%. Considering only the sugarcane agricultural areas, a value of 92% was achieved. Our study indicates that a multi-temporal data mining procedure can retrieve soil surface representation. The key to the results was calculating the median spectral reflectance from the bare soil pixels along the period of the time series.

Soil texture is also used to calculate soil's ability to retain water for plant growth. SOC and soil texture are thus important parameters of agricultural soils and need to be regularly monitored. Optical satellite remote sensing offers the potential for frequent surveys over large areas. In addition, the recently-operated Sentinel-2 missions provide free imagery. This study compared the capabilities of Sentinel 2 for monitoring and mapping of SOC and soil texture (clay, silt and sand content) with those obtained from airborne hyperspectral (CASI/SASI sensors) and lab ASD FieldSpec spectroradiometer measurements at four agricultural sites in the Czech Republic. Combination of 10 extracted bands of the Sentinel-2 and 18 spectral indices, as independent variables, were used to train prediction models and then produce spatial distribution maps of the selected attributes. Results showed that the prediction accuracy based on lab spectroscopy, airborne and Sentinel-2 in the majority of the sites was adequate for SOC and fair for clay; however, Sentinel-2 imagery could not be used to detect and map variations in silt and sand. The SOC and clay maps derived from the airborne and spaceborne datasets showed similar trend, with both performing better where SOC levels were relatively high, though at the highest levels Sentinel-2 was able to create the SOC map more precisely than the airborne sensors. Taken across all SOC levels measured in the reference data, Sentinel-2 results were marginally lower than lab spectroscopy and airborne imagery, but this reduction in precision may be offset by the extensive geographical coverage and more frequent revisit characteristic of satellite observation. The increased temporal revisit and area are expected to be positive enhancements to the acquisition of high-quality information on variations in SOC and clay content of bare soils.","[Gholizadeh, Asa; Zizala, Daniel; Boruvka, Lubos] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Agrobiol Food & Nat Resources, Dept Soil Sci & Soil Protect, Prague 16500, Czech Republic; [Zizala, Daniel] Res Inst Soil & Water Conservat, Prague 15627, Czech Republic; [Saberioon, Mohammadmehdi] Univ South Bohemia Ceske Budejovice, Inst Complex Syst, Fac Fisheries & Protect Waters, South Bohemian Res Ctr Aquaculture & Biodivers Hy, Nove Hrady 37333, Czech Republic",,"Boruvka, Lubos/0000-0001-5317-0933; Saberioon, Mohammadmehdi/0000-0003-1627-4957; Zizala, Daniel/0000-0002-7685-7604; ","Ministry of Agriculture of the Czech Republic project NAZV [QJ1610289]; Ministry of Agriculture of the Czech Republic project NAZV, Czechia [QK1720289]; Ministry of Education, Youth and Sport of the Czech Republic project CENAKVA [CZ.1.05/2.1.00/01.0024]; Ministry of Education, Youth and Sport of the Czech Republic project CENAKVA II, Czechia [LO1205]; Czech Science Foundation, Czechia [17-27726S]","Ministry of Agriculture of the Czech Republic project NAZV; Ministry of Agriculture of the Czech Republic project NAZV, Czechia; Ministry of Education, Youth and Sport of the Czech Republic project CENAKVA; Ministry of Education, Youth and Sport of the Czech Republic project CENAKVA II, Czechia; Czech Science Foundation, Czechia","The authors like to thank the partially financial support of the Ministry of Agriculture of the Czech Republic projects NAZV (project No. QJ1610289) and NAZV (project No. QK1720289), Czechia.

In this line, satellite images are useful tools that can assist in obtaining soil information from a synoptic point of view. This study aimed at evaluating how satellite images at different resolutions (spatial, spectral and temporal) can influence the representation of soil variability over time, the percentage of bare soil areas and spatial predictions of soil properties in southeastern Brazil. We used single-date and multi-temporal images (SYSI, Synthetic Soil Images) of bare soil pixels from the Sentinel2-MultiSpectral Instrument (S2-MSI) and the Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (L8-OLI) to conduct this research. Two SYSIs were obtained from images acquired in four years (2016-2019) for each satellite (SYSI S2-MSI and SYSI L8-OLI) and a third SYSI, named SYSI Combined, was obtained by combining the images from both satellites. The single date images for each satellite was acquired in September, when the influence of clouds was low and bare soil pixels was predominant. Single-date images and SYSIs were compared by means of their spectral patterns and ability to predict topsoil properties (clay, sand, silt, and organic matter contents and soil color) using the Cubist algorithm. We found that the SYSIs outperformed single-date images and that the SYSI Combined and SYSI L8OLI provided the best prediction performances. The SYSIs also had the highest percentage of areas with bare soil pixels (similar to 30-50%) when compared to the single-date images (similar to 20%). Our results suggest that bare soil images obtained by combining Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 images are more important for soil mapping than spatial or spectral resolutions. Soil maps obtained via satellite images are important tools for soil survey, land planning, management and precision agriculture.","[Quinonez Silvero, Nelida Elizabet; Melo Dematte, Jose Alexandre; Accorsi Amorim, Merilyn Taynara; dos Santos, Natasha Valadares; Rizzo, Rodnei; Safanelli, Jose Lucas; Poppiel, Raul Roberto; Mendes, Wanderson de Sousa; Bonfatti, Benito Roberto] Univ Sao Paulo, Luiz de Queiroz Coll Agr, Sao Paulo, Brazil",,"Mendes, Wanderson de Sousa/0000-0003-1271-031X; Poppiel, Ra√∫l Roberto/0000-0002-1628-4154; Dematt√™, Jos√© A.M./0000-0001-5328-0323; de Sousa Mendes, Wanderson/0000-0003-1271-031X; Quinonez Silvero, Nelida Elizabet/0000-0001-6021-2759; Safanelli, Jose Lucas/0000-0001-5410-5762; Amorim, Merilyn/0000-0003-4901-6962","National Scholarship Program Don Carlos Antonio Lopez (BECAL) of the Government of Paraguay; Sao Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP) [2014/22262-0, 2016/01597-6]",National Scholarship Program Don Carlos Antonio Lopez (BECAL) of the Government of Paraguay; Sao Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP)(Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP)),"We would like to thank the National Scholarship Program Don Carlos Antonio Lopez (BECAL) of the Government of Paraguay for granting the scholarship to the first author, the Sao Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP) for financial support (Project grant n. 2014/22262-0 and n. 2016/01597-6), the Geotechnologies on Soil Science team -GeoCIS (esalqgeocis.wixsite.com/english) and to everybody that directly or indirectly assisted in publishing this study.",,109.0,27.0,27.0,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,0034-4257,1879-0704,,REMOTE SENS ENVIRON,Remote Sens.

A total of seven flights between summer and autumn were conducted with a hyperspectral camera that captured 30 cm resolution imagery and 260 spectral bands in the 400-900 nm region. This enabled the identification of pure-vegetation tree crown pixels around an eddy covariance flux tower without shadow components or background effects. The hyperspectral imagery was used to study the temporal patterns of canopy fluorescence and reflectance indices related to physiology and canopy structure. The seasonal trends observed in the airborne indices and fluorescence and their relationship with gross primary production (GPP) demonstrated that vegetation indices mostly related to structure such as the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) yielded non-significant relationships (r(2) = 0.17; p > 0.05) due to the small structural changes in the canopy through the season. By contrast, physiological indices related to chlorophyll content (TCARI/OSAVI), light use efficiency (PRI570), and canopy chlorophyll fluorescence calculated through the Fraunhofer Line Depth principle (FLD3) showed a similar seasonal trend to that of GPP measured at the same time of the flights (r(2) in the range 0.75-0.84; p < 0.01). These results are consistent with the physiological trend observed during summer and autumn, which showed that chlorophyll content increased by 17.9% while the NDVI and the estimated tree crown projected LAI (LAI(p)) remained almost constant during the experiment (3% variation). The time-series hyperspectral dataset demonstrated that the seasonal trajectories of the NDVI and EVI were weakly related (p > 0.05) to the physiological indicators such as TCARI/OSAVI, PRI570 and fluorescence. The spatial variability of the hyperspectral indices investigated through the coefficient of variation (CV) showed that fluorescence around the tower varied up to 17% at the time of the maximum stress (summer), while LAI(p) showed little variation during that time (CV = 1.8%). After the summer stress period, the CV for fluorescence and chlorophyll content decreased in autumn down to 9%. This study demonstrates that small physiological changes occurring in an evergreen canopy were still captured by remote sensing physiological indices and high-resolution airborne fluorescence. These indicators are required for GPP monitoring when the vegetation dynamics are not captured by remote sensing structural indices. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.","[Zarco-Tejada, P.

However, quantifying and understanding the cropland C cycle are complex, due to variable environmental drivers, varied management practices and often highly heterogeneous landscapes. Efforts to upscale processes using simulation models must resolve these challenges. In this study we show how data assimilation (DA) approaches can link C cycle modelling to Earth observation (EO) and reduce uncertainty in upscaling. We evaluate a framework for the assimilation of leaf area index (LAI) time-series, derived from EO optical and radar sensors, for state-updating a model of crop development and C fluxes. Sensors are selected with fine spatial resolutions (20-50 m) to resolve variability across field sizes typically used in European agriculture (1.5-97.6 ha). Sequential DA is used to improve the canopy development simulation, which is validated by comparing time-series of net ecosystem exchange (NEE) predictions to independent eddy covariance observations at multiple European cereal crop sites. From assimilating all EO LAI estimates, results indicated adjustments in LAI and, through an enhanced representation of C exchanges, the predicted at-harvest cumulative NEE was improved for all sites by an average of 69% when compared to the model without DA. However, using radar sensors, being relatively unaffected by cloud cover and more sensitive to the structural properties of crops, further improvements were achieved when compared to the combined, and individual, use of optical data. Specifically, when assimilating radar LAI estimates only, the cumulative NEE estimation was improved by 79% when compared to the simulation without DA. Future developments would include the assimilation of additional state variables, such as soil moisture. (c) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

However, they are not well protected and are consequently being replaced by agricultural systems worldwide. Current monitoring efforts using remote sensing and ground-based methods are insufficient, and accordingly the mapping of grassland to cropland conversions must be improved to better document these changes in the Canadian Prairies. The purpose of this study is to evaluate different structural break methods and remote sensing datasets for their temporal accuracy in detecting grassland conversions in two Alberta study areas from 2010 to 2018. Breaks For Additive Seasonal and Trend (BFAST), BFAST Seasonal and Bayesian Estimator of Abrupt change, Seasonality and Trend (BEAST) methods were applied to evaluate their sensitivity to rangeland and pasture conversions. The best model was BFAST Seasonal, correctly predicting the year of change for 76% of rangelands and 66% of pastures. This demonstrates that seasonal models are effective in detecting interannual changes in vegetation composition amidst background noise from climate and management induced phenological changes. MODIS data outperformed Landsat, outlining the importance of high temporal resolution remote sensing data to successful change detection, even at the expense of higher spatial resolution. Overall, this study demonstrates that structural break methods are effective in identifying grassland to agriculture transitions and may be useful for the operational monitoring of grassland inventories in the future. ¬© 2021",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021,255,,,10.1016/j.rse.2021.112292,,,,57211931219;57211903687;9243904900;,112292,,,,7.0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85099512440&doi=10.1016%2fj.rse.2021.112292&partnerID=40&md5=a54c69c95b6a6214f588de1bd4fe6932,Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Climate models; Remote sensing; Agricultural system; Bayesian estimators; High temporal resolution; Multitemporal image analysis; Operational monitoring; Phenological changes; Remote sensing data; Vegetation composition; Climate change; Alberta,English,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85099512440,,,,Q1

Observations using remote sensing via the traditionally used visible-near infrared (VNIR) and shortwave infrared (SWIR) wavelength regions can be limited due to the special characteristics of such soils (e.g. rich in quartz, poor in clay minerals, coarse textured, and grain coatings). In this laboratory-based work we demonstrate the capabilities of the thermal infrared between 8 and 14. Œºm (longwave infrared) to detect and quantify small ranges of the soil properties sand-, clay, and soil organic carbon (SOC) content, as they appear in the semi-arid agricultural landscapes of the Mullewa region in Western Australia. All of the three soil properties could be predicted using the longwave infrared (LWIR) spectra with higher accuracy and precision than from the VNIR-SWIR wavelength region. The study revealed the complex relationships between the soil properties and the VNIR-SWIR soil spectra, which were caused by the spectral influence of the soils' grain coatings (based on iron and clay minerals). These difficulties could be handled more appropriately by the prediction models based on the LWIR soil spectra. Our results indicate that in order to quantitatively monitor farming areas for such erosion-related soil properties; remote sensing using the LWIR wavelength region would produce better estimates than using the wavelength ranges in the VNIR-SWIR. ¬© 2015 Elsevier Inc.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2015,163,,,10.1016/j.rse.2015.04.001,,,,57112191500;6602994648;23099866200;7004444572;55516561900;36154813700;6602866234;6603955392;6701381246;6602798575;55657538300;,,296.0,311.0,,41.0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84937760094&doi=10.1016%2fj.rse.2015.04.001&partnerID=40&md5=b311fb48d5ac8cb2b52ded9dcf373994,Agriculture; Carbon; Clay minerals; Coatings; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Grain (agricultural product); Infrared devices; Organic carbon; Particle size; Quartz; Remote sensing; Soils; Digital soil mappings; FTIR spectroscopy; Longwave infrared; Semi arid; Soil organic carbon; Soil property; Soil textures; Thermal infrared; Infrared radiation,English,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84937760094,,,,Q1

Particularly, tropical deforestation is a major driver of biodiversity decline and substantial carbon emissions. Regrowth of secondary vegetation may help to restore habitat for many threatened species and improve ecosystem services that deteriorated due to deforestation. However, spatial-temporal patterns of regrowing secondary vegetation in the tropics remain weakly understood. We therefore analyze regrowth dynamics across two different land use systems in southern Amazonia: the extensive pastoralism in Par√° and the capital-intensive agriculture in Mato Grosso. Both systems are connected by the BR-163 highway, which represents a major axis of deforestation and agricultural development in the Brazilian Amazon since decades. We used a 29¬†year time series of Landsat images to extract regrowth extent, duration, lag time between deforestation and regrowth, and frequency of regrowth cycles. Our results reached an overall accuracy of 89% and showed regrowth on up to 50% of the deforested area in Par√° and a maximum of 25% in Mato Grosso. In both states, annual regrowth rates drastically dropped after 1996, which coincided with socio-economic transformations and drought events.

The carbon allocation of crops, however, remains relatively understudied compared to, for example, forests. For comprehensive consistent resource assessments or climate change impact studies large-scale reliable vegetation information is needed. Here, we demonstrate how robust data on carbon uptake in croplands can be obtained by combining multiple sources to enhance the reliability of estimates. Using yield statistics, a remote-sensing based productivity algorithm and climate-sensitive potential productivity, we mapped the potential to increase crop productivity and compared consistent carbon uptake information of agricultural land with forests. The productivity gap in Europe is higher in Eastern and Southern than in Central-Western countries. At continental scale, European agriculture shows a greater carbon uptake in harvestable compartments than forests (agriculture 1.96 vs. forests 1.76 t C ha(-1) year(-1)). Mapping productivity gaps allows efforts to enhance crop production to be prioritized by, for example, improved crop cultivars, nutrient management or pest control. The concepts and methods for quantifying carbon uptake used in this study are applicable worldwide and allow forests and agriculture to be included in future carbon uptake assessments.

Accuratelymapping SOMat regional scales is of critical importance for sustainable agriculture and soil utilization management and remains a grand challenge. Many studies used soil sampling data and machine learning algorithms to predict SOM at regional scales for a given year, while few studies mapped SOM formultiple years and examined its temporal dynamics. We compared the performance of fourmachine learning algorithms: decision tree (DT), bagging decision tree (BDT), randomforest (RF), and gradient boosting regression trees (GBRT) in mapping SOM in Hubei province, China over the 18-year period from 2000 to 2017. Our results showed that RF and DT had the highest coefficient of determination (R-2) (0.61) and the lowest potential bias (9.48 g/kg), respectively, while GBRT had the lowest mean error (ME) (1.26 g/kg), root mean squared error (RMSE) (5.41 g/kg) and Lin's concordance correlation coefficient (LCCC) (0.72). The SOM map based on GBRT better captured the distribution of the soil sample data than that based on RF. The trained GBRT model and the spatially explicitly data on explanatory variables (e.g., climate, terrain, remote sensing) were used to predict SOM for each 500 m x 500 m grid cell in Hubei for the period from 2000 to 2017. Our results showed that the SOM content of cropland was relatively high in the southeast and relatively low in the north. The SOM content in the topsoil varied from 0.89 to 58.86 g/kg and was averaged at 20.52 g/kg. The mean cropland SOM content of the province exhibited an increasing trend from 2000 to 2017 with an increase of 0.26 g/kg and a growth rate of 1.28%. Spatially, the SOMcontent increased in southernHubei and decreased in central and northern parts of the province. A large portion of the areas with decreasing SOM content in northern Hubei was reclaimed cropland, while a large part of the high-quality cropland with rising SOM content in the east (similar to 0.45 x 10(4) ha) was lost due to land use change (e.g., urbanization).

Moreover, SOC depletion entails degradation of soil functions that support ecosystem services. Large areas covered by dry forests have been cleared in the Semiarid Chaco Region of Argentina for cropping expansion. However, deforestation impacts on the SOC stock and its distribution in the soil profile have been scarcely reported. We assessed these impacts based on the analysis of field data along a time-since-deforestation-for-cropping chronosequence, and remote sensing indices. Soil organic C was determined up to 100 cm depth and physically fractionated into mineral associated organic carbon (MAOC) and particulate organic C (POC). Models describing vertical distribution of SOC were fitted. Total SOC, POC and MAOC stocks decreased markedly with increasing cropping age. Particulate organic C was the most sensitive fraction to cultivation. After 10 yr of cropping SOC loss was around 30%, with greater POC loss (near 60%) and smaller MAOC loss (near 15%), at 0-30 cm depth. Similar relative SOC losses were observed in deeper soil layers (30-60 and 60-100 cm). Deforestation and subsequent cropping also modified SOC vertical distribution. Soil organic C loss was negatively associated with the proportion of maize in the rotation and total crop biomass inputs, but positively associated with the proportion of soybean in the rotation. Without effective land use polices, deforestation and agricultural expansion can lead to rapid soil degradation and reductions in the provision of important ecosystem services. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Frequent reclamation of wetlands and grasslands and intensive agricultural activity have induced significant changes in both land use/cover and soil physicochemical properties in the riparian zones of the middle Heihe River basin of China. The present study aims to explore whether land use/land cover change (LUCC) can well explain the variations in soil properties in the riparian zones of the middle Heihe River basin. To achieve this, we mapped LUCC and quantified the type of land use change using remote sensing images, topographic maps, and GIS analysis techniques. Forty-two sites were selected for soil and vegetation sampling. Then, physical and chemical experiments were employed to determine soil moisture, soil bulk density, soil pH, soil organic carbon, total nitrogen, total potassium, total phosphorous, available nitrogen, available potassium, and available phosphorous. The Independent-Samples Kruskal-Wallis Test, principal component analysis, and a scatter matrix were used to analyze the effects of LUCC on soil properties. The results indicate that the majority of the parameters investigated were affected significantly by LUCC. In particular, soil moisture and soil organic carbon can be explained well by land cover change and land use change, respectively. Furthermore, changes in soil moisture could be attributed primarily to land cover changes. Changes in soil organic carbon were correlated closely with the following land use change types: wetlands-arable, forest-grasslands, and grasslands-desert. Other parameters, including pH and total K, were also found to exhibit significant correlations with LUCC. However, changes in soil nutrients were shown to be induced most probably by human agricultural activity (i.e. fertilize, irrigation, tillage, etc.), rather than by simple conversions from one land use/cover types to the others.

Precise and robust prediction of SOC greatly contributes to carbon neutrality in the agricultural industry. To create more knowledge regarding the ability of remote sensing to monitor carbon soil, this research devises a state-of-the-art low cost machine learning model for quantifying agricultural soil carbon using active and ensemble-based decision tree learning combined with multi-sensor data fusion at a national and world scale. This work explores the use of Sentinel-1 (S1) C-band dual polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (SAR), Sentinel-2 (S2) multispectral data, and an innovative machine learning (ML) approach using an integration of active learning for land-use mapping and advanced Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) for robustness of the SOC estimates. The collected soil samples from a field survey in Western Australia were used for the model validation. The indicators including the coefficient of determination (R-2) and root - mean - square - error (RMSE) were applied to evaluate the model's performance. A numerous features computed from optical and SAR data fusion were employed to build and test the proposed model performance. The effectiveness of the proposed machine learning model was assessed by comparing with the two well-known algorithms such as Random Forests (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) to predict agricultural SOC. Results suggest that a combination of S1 and S2 sensors could effectively estimate SOC in farming areas by using ML techniques. Satisfactory accuracy of the proposed XGBoost with optimal features was achieved the highest performance (R-2 = 0.870; RMSE - 1.818 tonC/ha) which outperformed RF and SVM. Thus, multi-sensor data fusion combined with the XGBoost lead to the best prediction results for agricultural SOC at 10 m spatial resolution. In short, this new approach could significantly contribute to various agricultural SOC retrieval studies globally. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Farmland area has been reported to increase despite agriculture's vulnerability to climate variations. This great interplay among land-use dynamics, climate extremes, and food systems is, however, understudied. The current research, therefore, explores this interaction at both national and regional scales for the period between 2001 and 2017. Following an approach that employs remote sensing datasets on Net Primary Productivity (NPP), land cover types, drought indices, and climate variables, i.e. precipitation, temperature, and evapotranspiration, impacts of climate extremes and land cover changes on food production have been analysed. Similarly, the performance of ten major crops in Uganda over the last 6 decades has been detected using the Regime Shift technique. Key findings, thereof, indicate that NPP in farmlands is sensitive to climate variability, and this sensitivity varies spatially among the regions. Forests and permanent wetlands have been massively changed into farmlands, hence, moving a step forward into offsetting food insecurity but a step backward in preserving ecosystem services, espcially mitigating climate change. Furthermore, the noticeable increase in the total production of the major crops in Uganda seems to be derived mainly by the increase in area harvested affirming the step towards food security. However, the influences, thereof, may aggravate climate change impacts especially through reversing carbon sinks into carbon sources. This reversal could impact the crop yields further. Contrastingly, results from some crops illustrate the potential to increase crop production without necessarily expanding the cropland area. Therefore, Uganda may, instead, consider exploiting the maximum yield potential of crops through, for instance, augmenting rainfed agriculture with irrigation and enforcing effective policies rather than expanding farmland area. These findings collectively contribute further to our understanding of the importance of policies that ensure food security but at the same time preserve a healthy environment. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Natural factors such as soil types and topographical factors are important variables in mapping soil properties. Moreover, cropping systems are important components of agricultural activities and are significantly correlated with soil properties. Therefore, integrating cropping systems and natural factors can improve the accuracy of mapping farmland SOCD. This study aimed to obtain and incorporate cropping system information in mapping SOCD in plains by combining normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time-series data and the regression Kriging (RK) method. We collected 230 topsoil samples in Jianghan Plain, China and (i) obtained the spatial patterns of crops in summer and winter using NDVI time-series data derived from HJ-1A/1B satellite images, (ii) investigated the differences in SOCD under different cropping systems, and (iii) evaluated the performance of the RK_CS model in integrating cropping systems and natural factors into mapping SOCD. ANOVA results showed significant differences in SOCD under different cropping systems. Specifically, the SOCD of single rice was higher than that of rice-wheat rotation and dry crops. Meanwhile, the regression results showed that SOCD was affected by natural factors and cropping system, with the latter playing a major role. The integration of soil types, slope and cropping systems explained approximately 26.3% of the variation in SOCD. Model validation results confirmed the effectiveness of the RK_CS model. The findings reveal single cropping rice sequences more C than other cropping systems. Cropping system is an important environmental variable in improving mapping farmland SOCD in plains.

We also examined the potential to estimate N leaching employing N-sensitive spectral reflectance indices. During three growing seasons 2013-2015, field experiment at two experimental sites combining application of distinct N doses (0 (N-0), 35 (N-35), 70 (N-70), and 140 (N-140) kg N ha(-1)) and two stable forms of organic C (lignohumate and compost) was established to measure N uptake by winter wheat and its leaching to subsoil layers. The spectral reflectance al canopy level was measured simultaneously with N content in leaf dry matter at the beginning of the grain filling phase. At full maturity, the above-ground biomass, grain yield, and grain protein content were evaluated. That data was used to calculate N uptake in grain. The N-140 dose led to increased N uptake by grain of 64% and 73% in the wetter years 2013 and 2014, respectively, and even by 118% in the drier year 2015 in comparison with the N-0 treatment. N leaching to subsoil increased substantially with higher N close, but only in wetter years 2013 (by 74%) and 2014 (by 87%). By contrast, no effect of N dose on leached N was found in the dry year 2015. The application of organic C along with the N-140 dose substantially reduced N leaching by 26% and 29% in 2014 and 2015, respectively. Moreover, we demonstrated that normalized red-edge spectral reflectance index (NRERI) is able to predict N uptake by wheat and it can serve as an indicator of N leaching in heavy-rainfall years. Our results thus point towards possible agronomic practices and use of remote-sensing techniques to reduce groundwater contamination by N-based fertilizers. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Despite its importance, the current understanding of the magnitude or even the direction of SOC change in agricultural landscapes is limited. While changes in land use/land cover (LULC) and climate are among the main drivers of changes in SOC, their relative importance for the spatiotemporal assessment of SOC is unclear. This study evaluated LULC and SOC dynamics using archived and recent soil samples, remote sensing, and digital soil mapping in the Lower Fraser Valley of British Columbia, Canada. We combined both pixel- and object-based analysis of Landsat satellite imagery to assess LULC changes from 1984 to 2018. We achieved an overall accuracy of 81% and kappa coefficient of 0.77 for LULC classification using a random forest model. For predicting SOC for the same time period, we applied soil and vegetation indices derived from Landsat images, topographic indices, historic soil survey variables, and climate data in a random forest model. The SOC prediction of 2018 resulted in a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.67, concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) of 0.76, and normalized root mean square error (nRMSE) of 0.12. For 1984, the SOC prediction accuracies were 0.46, 0.58, and 0.18 for R2, CCC, and nRMSE, respectively. We detected SOC loss in 61%, gain in 12%, while 27% remained unchanged across the study area. Although we detected large losses of SOC due to LULC change, the majority of the SOC losses across the landscape were attributed to areas that were remained in the same type of agricultural production since 1984. Climate variability did not, however, have a strong effect on SOC changes. These results can inform decision making in the study area to support sustainable LULC management for enhancing SOC sequestration. ¬© 2020 Elsevier B.V.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2020,732,,,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138994,,,,55634366000;57216791277;54790508000;56205607900;6701849751;6506861695;23986977300;,138994,,,,3.0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85084647300&doi=10.1016%2fj.scitotenv.2020.138994&partnerID=40&md5=a58b1f25581546f5122e0b05db266c3c,"Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Climate models; Decision making; Decision trees; Forecasting; Land use; Mean square error; Organic carbon; Random forests; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Soil surveys; Soils; Agricultural landscapes; Agricultural productions; British Columbia , Canada; Correlation coefficient; Digital soil mappings; Object-based analysis; Random forest modeling; Root mean square errors; Climate change; organic carbon; soil organic carbon; soil organic matter; unclassified drug; accuracy assessment; agricultural land; heterogeneity; land cover; land use change; Landsat; organic carbon; prediction; satellite imagery; soil carbon; soil organic matter; agricultural land; Article; Canada; climate; controlled study; land use; landscape; measurement accuracy; nonhuman; prediction; priority journal; random forest; remote sensing; satellite imagery; soil change; vegetation; British Columbia; Canada; Fraser Valley",English,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85084647300,,,,Q1

Zhejiang Province has witnessed unprecedented LUCC concomitant with rapid urbanization from 1970 to 2010. In this study, remote sensing, geographic information system (GIS) and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) method were combined to quantify changes in both vegetation carbon storage and soil organic carbon (SOC) storage resulting from LUCC during 1970‚Äì1990 and 1990‚Äì2010. For both 1970‚Äì1990 and 1990‚Äì2010, the results showed successive decrease in farmlands (2.8 √ó 10 5 ha or ‚àí9.15% and 5.9 √ó 10 5 ha or ‚àí20.49%, respectively) and grasslands (3.4 √ó 10 4 ha or ‚àí10.73% and 1.5 √ó 10 5 ha or ‚àí54.1%, respectively), and continuous increase in forests (2.0 √ó 10 4 ha or 0.33% and 1.7 √ó 10 5 ha or 2.81%, respectively) and built-up lands (2.07 √ó 10 5 ha or 78.41% and 6.49 √ó 10 5 ha or 137.8%, respectively). From 1970 to 1990, approximately 8.3 Tg of the total carbon sink declined, including a 0.4 Tg reduction in vegetation carbon and a 7.9 Tg reduction in SOC. While from 1990 to 2010, approximately 17.5 Tg of carbon storage declined, comprising a 2.8 Tg of carbon accumulated by vegetation, and a 20.3 Tg reduction in SOC. Overall, LUCC has resulted in huge amount of carbon emissions in Zhejiang from 1970 to 2010. Efficient planning for LUCC and gradual mitigation of carbon emissions are indispensable for future urban development in China under increasing pressure from global warming. ¬© 2018",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2019,646,,,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.07.317,,,,57190731992;57220947691;57200388282;55303069800;57193331241;56203568900;38862827300;,,930.0,939.0,,56.0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85050601998&doi=10.1016%2fj.scitotenv.2018.07.317&partnerID=40&md5=f9f51fae6ecf15486b187407f71f4737,Global warming; Land use; Remote sensing; System-on-chip; Urban growth; Vegetation; Carbon emissions; Efficient planning; Global climate changes; Intergovernmental panel on climate changes; Land use and land cover change; LUCC; Rapid urbanizations; Soil organic carbon storages; Organic carbon; carbon; organic carbon; carbon; carbon emission; carbon sequestration; climate change; GIS; global climate; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; land cover; land use change; remote sensing; soil carbon; agricultural land; Article; carbon footprint; carbon storage; China; climate change; forest; geographic information system; grassland; greenhouse effect; human; land cover change; land use; priority journal; remote sensing; urbanization; vegetation; agriculture; air pollution; analysis; environmental monitoring; forest; soil; statistics and numerical data; China; Zhejiang; Agriculture; Air Pollution; Carbon; China; Environmental Monitoring; Forests; Soil,English,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85050601998,,,,Q1

However, large datasets needed to accurately assess SOC at high resolution across scales are labor-intensive, time-consuming, and expensive. Ancillary geodata, including remote sensing spectral indices (RS-SIs) and topographic indicators (TIs), have been proposed as spatial covariates. Reported relationships between SOC and RS-SIs are erratic, possibly because single-date RS-SIs do not accurately capture SOC spatial variability due to transient confounding factors in the soil (e.g., moisture). However, multitemporal RS-SI data analysis may lead to noise reduction in SOC versus RS-SI relationships. This study aimed at: i) comparing single-date versus multitemporal RS-Sis derived from Sentinel-2 imagery for assessment of topsoil (0‚Äì0.2 m) SOC in two agricultural fields located in south-eastern Brazil; ii) comparing the performance of RS-SIs and TIs; iii) using adequate RS-SIs and TIs to compare sampling schemes defined on different collection grids; and iv) studying the temporal changes of SOC (0‚Äì0.2 m and 0.2‚Äì0.4 m). Results showed that: i) single-date RS-SIs were not reliable proxies for topsoil SOC at the study sites. For most of the tested RS-SIs, multitemporal data analysis produced accurate proxies for SOC; e.g., for the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, the 4.5th multitemporal percentile predicted SOC with an R2 of 0.64; ii) The best TI was elevation (ranging from 643 to 684 m) with an R2 of 0.70; iii) The multitemporal SI and elevation maps indicated that the different sampling schemes were equally representative of the topsoil SOC's distribution across the entire area; and iv) From 2012 through 2019, topsoil SOC increased from 19.3 to 24.1 g kg‚àí1. The ratio between SOC in the topsoil and subsoil (0.2‚Äì0.4 m) decreased from 1.7 to 1.1. Further testing of the proposed multitemporal RS-SI analysis is necessary to confirm its dependability for SOC assessment in Brazil and elsewhere. ¬© 2021 Elsevier B.V.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021,784,,,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.147216,,,,57194171608;55022751800;57093890500;7003352243;,147216,,,,1.0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85105695483&doi=10.1016%2fj.scitotenv.2021.147216&partnerID=40&md5=d95ed2ad65941a12b81e902fe4700aa8,Data handling; Large dataset; Noise abatement; Organic carbon; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Soils; Crop rotation; Multi-temporal; Multi-temporal remote sensing; Reduced tillage; Remote-sensing; Sentinel-2; Soil organic carbon; Spectral indices; Sustainable agriculture; Topsoil; Agriculture; organic carbon; agricultural soil; alternative agriculture; crop rotation; farm; image analysis; organic carbon; remote sensing; satellite imagery; Sentinel; soil carbon; soil organic matter; tillage; accuracy; agricultural land; Article; Brazil; data analysis; data processing; image analysis; irrigation (agriculture); prediction; remote sensing; satellite imagery; soil chemistry; time series analysis; Brazil,English,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85105695483,,,,Q1

A visible and near infrared (VisNIR) integrated multi-sensing penetrometer system was developed to automatically measure in situ soil VisNIR reflectance spectra, penetration resistance, and insertion depth along a soil profile. The system was tested in 11 agricultural fields in Nebraska, Illinois, Iowa, and South Dakota of the U.S. An independent soil VisNIR spectral library was used to build calibration models for soil property prediction. External Parameter Orthogonalization (EPO) was used to correct for the field intactness of in situ VisNIR spectra. The results showed that EPO was effective in correcting for the spectral disparity between in situ and dry-ground VisNIR spectra. The EPO correction showed an improvement of prediction accuracy of soil total carbon (R-2 and RMSE improved from 0.29 and 3.06 % to 0.5 and 0.79%, respectively) and total nitrogen (R-2 and RMSE improved from 0.51 and 0.36 % to 0.62 and 0.06 %, respectively). The system also predicted soil bulk density with an RMSE of 0.12 g cm(-3) and R-2 of 0.80.

When using environmental covariates to map SOC content or stock, variables indicating human activities have drawn growing attentions. Crop species/crop rotations and agricultural management significantly affect the spatial variation of SOC in croplands. For areas where climatic conditions and farming managements are generally consistent in cultivation territory of one crop species, crop phenology largely indicates the crop response to soil. Therefore, phenological parameters incorporating with crop rotation could be effective for mapping soil organic carbon in these areas. In this study, we extracted phenological parameters from Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series data, and used these variables with crop rotation for predicting topsoil organic carbon content in a cropland area in Anhui province, China. Forty-nine sampling points were collected in field. For these points, there were three crop rotations each with two crop species per year. Twenty-two HJ-1 A/B images for 2010 year with a 30 m resolution were obtained. Eleven phenological parameters for each of the two growing seasons were obtained with a dynamic threshold method. Various combinations of predictive variables were developed based on variable importance and experimented for predicting topsoil organic carbon using random forest. The prediction results were validated using a cross validation approach. Results showed that base levels (given as the average of the left and right minimum values of a time series profile) for both seasons were the most important predictors in this area. Adding both crop rotation and the two phenological parameters to the natural environment variables increased the prediction accuracies by 50% in terms of R-2 and 13.4% in terms of root mean square error (RMSE). This study demonstrates the effectiveness of crop phenology in mapping SOC in croplands.","[Yang, Lin; He, Xianglin; Shen, Feixue; Zhou, Chenghu; Li, Manchun] Nanjing Univ, Sch Geog & Ocean Sci, Nanjing 210023, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Yang, Lin; Zhou, Chenghu; Zhu, A-Xing] Chinese Acad Sci, State Key Lab Resources & Environm Informat Syst, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Zhu, A-Xing] Nanjing Normal Univ, Key Lab Virtual Geog Environm, Minist Educ, Nanjing 210023, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Gao, Bingbo] China Agr Univ, Coll Land Sci & Technol, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Chen, Ziyue] Beijing Normal Univ, Coll Global Change & Earth Syst Sci, State Key Lab Remote Sensing Sci, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China",,"Shen, feixue/0000-0002-8039-6062; Yang, Lin/0000-0002-7576-4481","National Natural Science Foundation of China [41971054, 41471178, 41530749]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [020914380049, 020914380056]; Leading Funds for the First class Universities [020914912203, 020914902302]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); Leading Funds for the First class Universities,"This study is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Project No. 41971054; 41471178; 41530749), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (020914380049 and 020914380056), and the Leading Funds for the First class Universities (020914912203 and 020914902302).",,105.0,25.0,26.0,ELSEVIER,0167-1987,1879-3444,,SOIL TILL RES,Soil Tillage Res.,FEB,2020,196,,104465,10.1016/j.still.2019.104465,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.still.2019.104465,,13.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Q1

At regional and global scales, digital mapping of SOC has been successful using environmental variables such as climatic, land use and terrain factors. However, such a mapping for agricultural lands in low-relief areas cannot be resolved due to weak spatial variations of the environmental variables. An alternative approach, based on time series of remote sensing images, has recently been emphasized in estimating SOC since crop growth status clearly revealed by satellite images is strongly related to SOC. However, there is still a lack of full understanding of impacts of factors such as data source, regression techniques, and spatial resolution on the accuracy of SOC mapping using time series of satellite images. In this study, prediction variables including four spectral bands (i.e., blue, green, red, and near-infrared bands) and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) from Sentinel 2, Gaofen (GF) 1, and Landsat 8 data, acquired between November 2017 to March 2018, were individually used to estimate SOC by stepwise regression (STR), partial least squares regression (PLSR), and extreme learning machine (ELM). Besides, we further explored the influence of satellite parameters, such as scanning time, spectral bands and vegetation indices on predicting SOC using Sentinel 2 time series images. Results showed that: (1) the time series of remote sensing images can be used to map SOC in smalland large-extent low-relief areas with low evaluated root mean square errors (0.199 % and 0.249 %) and high R2 (0.555 and 0.528), (2) SOC estimations from the Sentinel-2 time series images, compared to those from Landsat 8 and GF 1 datasets, exhibited a better accuracy, and the ELM yielded a better prediction accuracy than PLSR and STR, (3) the satellite parameters of the spatial resolution, the acquisition time and the spectral bands significantly affected the prediction accuracy. This study offers more comprehensive information than terrain factors for revealing the influence of satellite parameters on predicting SOC, and provides great help for constructing one more suitable and higher precision soil mapping strategy for agricultural lands in low-relief areas.","[Guo, Long; Zeng, Chen; Zhang, Haitao; Wang, Shanqin] Huazhong Agr Univ, Coll Resources & Environm, Wuhan 430070, Peoples R China; [Guo, Long; Zeng, Chen; Zhang, Haitao; Wang, Shanqin] Huazhong Agr Univ, Res Ctr Terr Spatial Governance & Green Dev, Wuhan 430070, Peoples R China; [Fu, Peng] Univ Illinois, Dept Plant Biol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Shi, Tiezhu] Shenzhen Univ, Key Lab Geoenvironm Monitoring Coastal Zone Natl, Shenzhen 518060, Peoples R China; [Shi, Tiezhu] Shenzhen Univ, Shenzhen Key Lab Spatial Smart Sensing & Serv, Shenzhen 518060, Peoples R China; [Shi, Tiezhu] Shenzhen Univ, Coll Life Sci & Oceanog, Shenzhen 518060, Peoples R China; [Chen, Yiyun] Wuhan Univ, Sch Resource & Environm Sci, Wuhan 430079, Peoples R China",,"Fu, Peng/0000-0003-1568-1518","Independent Technology Innovation Fund of Huazhong Agricultural University [26620208HPY006]; Open project of the Key Laboratory of Aquatic Plants and Watershed Ecology, Chinese Academy of Sciences [Y852721s04]; Natural Science Foundation of Hubei [2018CFB372]; Open project of the MNR Key Laboratory for Geo-Environmental Monitoring of Great Bay Area","Independent Technology Innovation Fund of Huazhong Agricultural University; Open project of the Key Laboratory of Aquatic Plants and Watershed Ecology, Chinese Academy of Sciences; Natural Science Foundation of Hubei(Natural Science Foundation of Hubei Province); Open project of the MNR Key Laboratory for Geo-Environmental Monitoring of Great Bay Area","This research was funded by the Independent Technology Innovation Fund of Huazhong Agricultural University (26620208HPY006), the Open project of the Key Laboratory of Aquatic Plants and Watershed Ecology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (Y852721s04), the Natural Science Foundation of Hubei (2018CFB372), and the DOpen project of the MNR Key Laboratory for Geo-Environmental Monitoring of Great Bay Area.",,81.0,5.0,6.0,ELSEVIER,0167-1987,1879-3444,,SOIL TILL RES,Soil Tillage Res.,JUN,2021,210,,104982,10.1016/j.still.2021.104982,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.still.2021.104982,21-Mar,12.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Q1

Although the consequences of soil quality reduction are generally recognized, the spatial extent of soil degradation is difficult to determine, because no universal equation or soil quality prediction model exists that fits all ecoregions. Furthermore, existing soil organic C (SOC) models generate estimates with uncertainties that may exceed 50%. Therefore it is possible that drastic changes in soil quality may be occurring in sites which are not identifiable on existing maps. Soil quality can either be directly inferred from SOC concentration, or through the assessment of the soil physical, chemical and biologic properties. Assessing the spatial distribution of SOC over large areas requires the calibration and development of models derived from laboratory or field based techniques. However, mapping SOC concentration in all soils is logistically challenging by using normal standard survey techniques. The availability of new generations of remotely sensed datasets and geographical information system (GIS) models (i.e. GEMS, RothC, and CENTURY) provides new opportunities for predicting soil properties and quality at different spatial scales.

Agriculture being a predominant global land use, C sequestration under different agro-ecosystems through appropriate management practices is an important option to combat the anthropogenic climate change. Conservation tillage along with residue management, stubble retention, mulching, organic farming and integrated nutrient management not only facilitates soil C storage but also improves soil health. Change in land-uses and cropping system also impart notable effects on soil C turnover. Biochar application is found effective in augmenting soil C stock and improving soil aggregation. Bioenergy plantations are also effective in sequestering C. Simulation models and remote sensing are innovative tools for predicting and mapping soil C status and identifying site-specific strategic policies to minimize the risk of land degradation and to maintain environmental sustainability. Therefore, the aim of this review is to disseminate ideas regarding current C status, identify researchable priorities and to deliberate pros and cons of agricultural management practices for better implementation of soil C sequestration strategies for mitigating the consequences of climate change.","[Mandal, Agniva; Mani, Pabitra Kumar] Bidhan Chandra Krishi Viswavidyalaya, Dept Agr Chem & Soil Sci, Mohanpur, India; [Mandal, Agniva; Mani, Pabitra Kumar] Bidhan Chandra Agr Univ BCKV Campus, Bhabha Atom Res Ctr RNARC BARC, Reg Nucl Agr Res Ctr, Mohanpur, W Bengal, India; [Majumder, Atin] Indian Inst Remote Sensing IIRS ISRO, Agr & Soil Dept, Dehra Dun, Uttarakhand, India; [Dhaliwal, S.

While the status and trends of national forest monitoring capacities have been previously assessed for the tropics, this has not been systematically done worldwide. In this paper, we assess the use and quality of forest monitoring data sources for national reporting to the FRA in 236 countries and territories. More specifically, we (a) analyze the use of remote sensing (RS) for forest area monitoring and the use of national forest inventory (NFI) for monitoring forest area, growing stock, biomass, carbon stock, and other attributes in FRA 2005-2020, (b) assess data quality in FRA 2020 using FAO tier-based indicators, and (c) zoom in to investigate changes in tropical forest monitoring capacities in FRA 2010-2020. Globally, the number of countries monitoring forest area using RS at good to very good capacities increased from 55 in FRA 2005 to 99 in FRA 2020. Likewise, the number of countries with good to very good NFI capacities increased from 48 in FRA 2005 to 102 in FRA 2020. This corresponds to ‚àº85% of the global forest area monitored with one or more nationally-produced up-to-date RS products or NFI in FRA 2020. For large proportions of global forests, the highest quality data was used in FRA 2020 for reporting on forest area (93%), growing stock (85%), biomass (76%), and carbon pools (61%). Overall, capacity improvements are more widespread in the tropics, which can be linked to continued international investments for forest monitoring especially in the context of reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation in tropical countries (REDD+). More than 50% of the tropical countries with targeted international support improved both RS and NFI capacities in the period 2010-2020 on top of those that already had persistent good to very good capabilities. There is also a link between improvements in national capacities and improved governance measured against worldwide governance indicators (WGI). Our findings - the first global study - suggest an ever-improving data basis for national reporting on forest resources in the context of climate and development commitments, e.g. the Paris Agreement and Sustainable Development Goals. ¬© 2021 The Author(s).

The estimates are aggregated spatially to Southeast, East, and South Asia and temporally for three decades, 1980-1989, 1990-1999 and 2000-2009. Since 1980, net carbon emissions from LULCC in Asia were responsible for 20%-40% of global LULCC emissions, with emissions from Southeast Asia alone accounting for 15%-25% of global LULCC emissions during the same period. In the 2000s and for all Asia, three estimates (FAO-FRA, DGVM, Houghton) were in agreement of a net source of carbon to the atmosphere, with mean estimates ranging between 0.24 to 0.41 Pg C yr-1, whereas EDGARv4.3 suggested a net carbon sink of -0.17 Pg C yr-1. Three of 4 estimates suggest that LULCC carbon emissions declined by at least 34% in the preceding decade (1990-2000). Spread in the estimates is due to the inclusion of different flux components and their treatments, showing the importance to include emissions from carbon rich peatlands and land management, such as shifting cultivation and wood harvesting, which appear to be consistently underreported. ¬© 2016 IOP Publishing Ltd.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2016,11,7,,10.1088/1748-9326/11/7/074011,,,,56581860700;7006765673;7005113352;55399842300;7003280188;57201951903;55329155500;6701581547;6701820813;35737202600;24778585500;7102677917;15065751600;6603113016;35765781400;57190434911;24339847400;57203178036;23012982500;,74011,,,,24.0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84980028613&doi=10.1088%2f1748-9326%2f11%2f7%2f074011&partnerID=40&md5=5c97c426b3e36a32c4e156d5febc7f7d,Agriculture; Budget control; Cultivation; Deforestation; Forestry; Remote sensing; Carbon budgets; Food and agriculture organizations; Forest resource assessments; Land use and land cover change; Land-use change; Multiple data sources; Remote sensing techniques; Shifting cultivations; Land use; atmosphere-biosphere interaction; carbon emission; carbon flux; carbon sink; deforestation; Food and Agricultural Organization; land cover; land management; land use change; peatland; regional climate; remote sensing; Southeast Asia,English,Final,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84980028613,,,,Q1

Remote sensing has become an important tool to quantify and display swidden agriculture in transition. Due to its diversity, dynamics, and complexity, however, the development of universal remote sensing algorithms for mapping swidden agriculture faces major challenges. Although swidden agriculture has increasingly become the focus of climate change and other sustainable initiatives, a systematic review on remote sensing of this farming system in the tropics is seldom reported. With 89 peer-reviewed journal articles related to the identification, mapping, monitoring or forecast of swidden agriculture since the 1970s, the methodological progresses and shortcomings of remote sensing of swidden agriculture were compared and summarized, followed by providing several perspectives on near-future research directions. The conclusions were drawn as follows. Firstly, the limited remote sensing studies of swidden agriculture were mostly reported in Southeast Asia (66%), followed by Latin America and Central Africa. Secondly, Landsat is the most (59%) widely applied to monitor swidden agriculture and also holds huge potential in delineating its trajectories. Thirdly, the spectral feature-based algorithms (76%) are more used than the counterparts of geometric-based and structure-based ones. Finally, several aspects including exploring new data and algorithms for the enhancement of remote sensing of swidden agriculture have been proposed.

Improving food security in Africa will require a good understanding of farming systems yields as well as reducing yield gaps (i.e., the difference between potential yield and actual farmer yield). To this end, crop yield gap practices in African countries need to be understood to fill this gap while decreasing the environmental impacts of agricultural systems. For instance, the variability of yields has been demonstrated to be strongly controlled by soil fertilizer use, irrigation management, soil attribute, and the climate. Consequently, the quantitative assessment and mapping information of soil attributes such as nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), soil organic carbon (SOC), moisture content (MC), and soil texture (i.e., clay, sand and silt contents) on the ground are essential to potentially reducing the yield gap. However, to assess, measure, and monitor these soil yield-related parameters in the field, there is a need for rapid, accurate, and inexpensive methods. Recent advances in remote sensing technologies and high computational performances offer a unique opportunity to implement cost-effective spatiotemporal methods for estimating crop yield with important levels of scalability. However, researchers and scientists in Africa are not taking advantage of the opportunity of increasingly available geospatial remote sensing technologies and data for yield studies. The objectives of this report are to (i) conduct a review of scientific literature on the current status of African yield gap analysis research and their variation in regard to soil properties management by using remote sensing techniques; (ii) review and describe optimal yield practices in Africa; and (iii) identify gaps and limitations to higher yields in African smallholder farms and propose possible improvements. Our literature reviewed 80 publications and covered a period of 22 years (1998-2020) over many selected African countries with a potential yield improvement. Our results found that (i) the number of agriculture yield-focused remote sensing studies has gradually increased, with the largest proportion of studies published during the last 15 years; (ii) most studies were conducted exclusively using multispectral Landsat and Sentinel sensors; and (iii) over the past decade, hyperspectral imagery has contributed to a better understanding of yield gap analysis compared to multispectral imagery; (iv) soil nutrients (i.e., NPK) are not the main factor influencing the studied crop productivity in Africa, whereas clay, SOC, and soil pH were the most examined soil properties in prior papers. ¬© 2021 by the authors.

It provides various valuable subsistence products to local farmers, mostly the poor ethnic minority groups. Controversially, it is also closely connected with a number of environmental issues. With the strengthening regional economic cooperation in SEA, swidden agriculture has experienced drastic transformations into other diverse market-oriented land use types since the 1990s. However, there is very limited information on the basic geographical and demographic data of swidden agriculture and the socio-economic and biophysical effects of the transformations. International programs, such as the Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD), underscore the importance of monitoring and evaluating swidden agriculture and its transition to reduce carbon emission due to deforestation and forest degradation. In this context, along with the accessibility of Landsat historical imagery, remote sensing based techniques will offer an effective way to detect and monitor the locations and extent of swidden agriculture. Many approaches for investigating fire occurrence and burned area can be introduced for swidden agriculture mapping due to the common feature of fire relatedness. In this review paper, four broad approaches involving spectral signatures, phenological characteristics, statistical theory and landscape ecology were summarized for swidden agriculture delineation. Five research priorities about swidden agriculture involving remote sensing techniques, spatial pattern, change, drivers and impacts were proposed accordingly. To our knowledge, a synthesis review on the remote sensing and outlook on swidden agriculture has not been reported yet. This review paper aims to give a comprehensive overview of swidden agriculture studies in the domains of debated definition, trends, remote sensing methods and outlook research in SEA undertaken in the past two decades.¬©2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2014,6,2,,10.3390/rs6021654,,,,55872049000;7403442866;14031384700;55871503800;56084235500;,,1654.0,1683.0,,70.0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84896847469&doi=10.3390%2frs6021654&partnerID=40&md5=ca2ef65e215431e3b40e01537ca4f22d,Environmental issues; Fire-related; Impacts; International program; REDD; Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD); Remote sensing techniques; Southeast Asia; Deforestation; Economics; Land use; Regional planning; Remote sensing; Reviews; Truck drivers; Agriculture; Agriculture; Deforestation; Economics; Land Use; Remote Sensing,English,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-84896847469,,,,Q1

Component flux estimate methods we consider sufficiently reliable for this purpose encompass fossil fuel emission inventories, biometric analysis of old-growth rainforests, estimation of carbon release associated with deforestation based on remote sensing and inventories, and agricultural export data. Alternative methods for the estimation of the continental-scale net land to atmosphere CO2 flux, such as atmospheric transport inverse modelling and terrestrial biosphere model predictions, are, we find, hampered by the data paucity, and improved parameterisation and validation exercises are required before reliable estimates can be obtained. From our analysis of available data, we suggest that South America was a net source to the atmosphere during the 1980s (~ 0.3–0.4 Pg C a_1) and close to neutral (~ 0.1 Pg C a_1) in the 1990s. During the latter period, carbon uptake in old-growth forests nearly compensated for the carbon release associated with fossil fuel burning and deforestation. 
Annual mean precipitation over tropical South America as inferred from Amazon River discharge shows a long-term upward trend. Although, over the last decade dry seasons have tended to be drier, with the years 2005 and 2010 in particular experiencing strong droughts. On the other hand, precipitation during the wet seasons also shows an increasing trend. Air temperatures have also increased slightly. Also with increases in atmospheric CO2 concentrations, it is currently unclear what effect these climate changes are having on the forest carbon balance of the region. Current indications are that the forests of the Amazon Basin have acted as a substantial long-term carbon sink, but with the most recent measurements suggesting that this sink may be weakening. Economic development of the tropical regions of the continent is advancing steadily, with exports of agricultural products being an important driver and witnessing a strong upturn over the last decade.",,,,,,,,,,,Copernicus GmbH,,,,,,,2012,9,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Biogeosciences,12.0,5407-5430,Q1

Despite the need for spatial assessments of SOC content over time, reliable estimates from traditional field survey methods are limited by data availability; where measurements are often made at discrete point locations, at a coarse sample spacing or over a limited spatial extent. Remote sensing (RS) is in a strong position to provide spatially distributed, reproducible, scale-appropriate and resource-efficient measurements of SOC content and fluxes at field, landscape and regional scales. This paper provides a critical review of optical RS techniques for such applications. The first part of the paper reviews the methods, instruments and techniques used for developing predictive models for monitoring spatial SOC content. Secondly, sources of spatio-temporal SOC variations are examined, including the lateral transfer of SOC by erosion, soil structural breakdown and land management practices, in the context of RS data and techniques. The key challenges of using RS to monitor SOC contents are discussed along with opportunities for improving SOC predictions within a spatial framework. Such opportunities include the use of ancillary data, scale-specific methods, improved development of spectral libraries and better integration of RS technologies into empirical and simulation SOC models.

Here we modelled the topsoil (0–0.3 m) SOC concentration of the cultivated area of Sicily in 1993 and 2008. Sicily is an extremely variable region with a high number of ecosystems, soils, and microclimates. We studied the role of time and land use in the modelling of SOC, and assessed the role of remote sensing (RS) covariates in the boosted regression trees modelling. The models obtained showed a high pseudo-R2 (0.63–0.69) and low uncertainty (s.d. < 0.76 g C kg_ 1 with RS, and < 1.25 g C kg_ 1 without RS). These outputs allowed depicting a time variation of SOC at 1 arcsec. SOC estimation strongly depended on the soil texture, land use, rainfall and topographic indices related to erosion and deposition. RS indices captured one fifth of the total variance explained, slightly changed the ranking of variance explained by the non-RS predictors, and reduced the variability of the model replicates. During the study period, SOC decreased in the areas with relatively high initial SOC, and increased in the area with high temperature and low rainfall, dominated by arables. This was likely due to the compulsory application of some Good Agricultural and Environmental practices. These results confirm that the importance of texture and land use in short-term SOC variation is comparable to climate. The present results call for agronomic and policy intervention at the district level to maintain fertility and yield potential. In addition, the present results suggest that the application of RS covariates enhanced the modelling performance.",,,,,,,,,,,Elsevier,,,,,,,2017,601,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Science of the total environment,,821-832,Q1

Today, this role must be satisfied within a context of environmental sustainability and climate change, combined with an unprecedented and still-expanding human population size, while maintaining the viability of agricultural activities to ensure both subsistence and livelihoods. Remote sensing has the capacity to assist the adaptive evolution of agricultural practices in order to face this major challenge, by providing repetitive information on crop status throughout the season at different scales and for different actors. We start this review by making an overview of the current remote sensing techniques relevant for the agricultural context. We present the agronomical variables and plant traits that can be estimated by remote sensing, and we describe the empirical and deterministic approaches to retrieve them. A second part of this review illustrates recent research developments that permit to strengthen applicative capabilities in remote sensing according to specific requirements for different types of stakeholders. Such agricultural applications include crop breeding, agricultural land use monitoring, crop yield forecasting, as well as ecosystem services in relation to soil and water resources or biodiversity loss.

Thus, this study aims at comparing the capability of multispectral S2 and airborne hyperspectral remote sensing data for SOC prediction, and at the same time, we investigated the importance of spectral and spatial resolution through the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the variable importance in the prediction (VIP) models and the spatial variability of the SOC maps at field and regional scales. We tested the capability of the S2 data to predict SOC in croplands with quite different soil types and parent materials in Germany, Luxembourg and Belgium, using multivariate statistics and local ground calibration with soil samples. We split the calibration dataset into sub-regions according to soil maps and built a multivariate regression model within each sub-region. The prediction accuracy obtained by S2 data is generally slightly lower than that retrieved by airborne hyperspectral data. The ratio of performance to deviation (RPD) is higher than 2 in Luxembourg (2.6) and German (2.2) site, while it is 1.1 in the Belgian area. After the spectral resampling of the airborne data according to S2 band, the prediction accuracy did not change for four out of five of the sub-regions. The variable importance values obtained by S2 data showed the same trend as the airborne VIP values, while the importance of SWIR bands decreased using airborne data resampled according the S2 bands. These differences of VIP values can be explained by the loss of spectral resolution as compared to APEX data and the strong difference in terms of SNR between the SWIR region and other spectral regions. The investigation on the spatial variability of the SOC maps derived by S2 data has shown that the spatial resolution of S2 is adequate to describe SOC variability both within field and at regional scale.",,,,,,,,,,,Elsevier,,,,,,,2019,147,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing,,267-282,Q1

Four current (EO-1 ALI and Hyperion, Landsat 8 OLI, Sentinel-2 MSI) and three forthcoming (EnMAP, PRISMA and HyspIRI) satellite imagers were compared. To this aim, two soil spectra datasets that simulated each imager were obtained: (i) resampled spectra according to the specific spectral response and resolution of each satellite imager and (ii) resampled spectra with declared or actual noise (radiometric and atmospheric) added. Compared with those using full spectral resolution data, the accuracy of Partial Least Square Regression (PLSR) predictive models generally decreased when using resampled spectra. In the absence of noise, the performances of hyperspectral imagers, in terms of Ratio of Performance to Interquartile Range (RPIQ), were generally significantly better than those of multispectral imagers. For instance the best RPIQ for sand estimation was obtained using EnMAP simulated data (2.56), whereas the outcomes gained using multispectral imagers varied from 1.56 and 2.28. The addition of noise to the simulated spectra brought about a decrease of statistical accuracy in all estimation models, especially for Hyperion data. Although the addition of noise reduced the performance differences between multispectral and hyperspectral imagers, the forthcoming hyperspectral imagers nonetheless provided the best RPIQ values for clay (2.16–2.33), sand (2.10–2.17), silt (2.77–2.85) and organic carbon (2.48–2.51) estimation. To better understand the impact of spectral resolution and signal to noise ratio (SNR) on the estimation of soil variables, PLSR models were applied to resampled and simulated spectra, iteratively increasing the bandwidth to: 10, 20, 40, 80 and 160 nm. Results showed that, for a bandwidth of 40 nm, i.e., a spectral resolution lower than that of current and forthcoming imagers, the estimation accuracy was very similar to that obtained with a higher spectral resolution. Forthcoming hyperspectral imagers will therefore improve the accuracy of soil variables estimation from bare soil imagery with respect to the results achievable by current hyperspectral and multispectral imagers, however this improvement is still too limited, to allow an accurate quantitative estimation of soil texture and SOC. This work provides useful indications about what could be expected, for the estimation of the most important soil variables, from the next generation of hyperspectral satellite imagers.",,,,,,,,,,,Elsevier,,,,,,,2016,179,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Remote Sensing of Environment,,54-65,Q1

However, mapping SOC stocks in semi-arid rangelands is challenging due to the lack of data and poor spatial coverage. The use of remote sensing data to provide an indirect measurement of SOC to inform digital soil mapping has the potential to provide more reliable and cost-effective estimates of SOC compared with field-based, direct measurement. Despite this potential, the role of remote sensing data in improving the knowledge of soil information in semi-arid rangelands has not been fully explored. This study firstly investigated the use of high spatial resolution satellite data (seasonal fractional cover data; SFC) together with elevation, lithology, climatic data and observed soil data to map the spatial distribution of SOC at two soil depths (0–5 cm and 0–30 cm) in semi-arid rangelands of eastern Australia. Overall, model performance statistics showed that random forest (RF) and boosted regression trees (BRT) models performed better than support vector machine (SVM). The models obtained moderate results with R2of 0.32 for SOC stock at 0–5 cm and 0.44 at 0–30 cm, RMSE of 3.51 Mg C ha_1 at 0–5 cm and 9.16 Mg C ha_1 at 0–30 cm without considering SFC covariates. In contrast, by including SFC, the model accuracy for predicting SOC stock improved by 7.4–12.7% at 0–5 cm, and by 2.8–5.9% at 0–30 cm, highlighting the importance of including SFC to enhance the performance of the three modelling techniques.

The availability of satellite observations of the land surface since the 1970s, particularly the early 1980s, has made it feasible to quantify ecosystem carbon fluxes and stocks at regional to global scales. Here we provide a review of the advances in remote sensing of the terrestrial carbon cycle from the early 1970s to present. First, we present an overview of the terrestrial carbon cycle and remote sensing of carbon fluxes and stocks. Remote sensing data acquired in a broad wavelength range (visible, infrared, and microwave) of the electromagnetic spectrum have been used to estimate carbon fluxes and/or stocks. Second, we provide a historical overview of the key milestones in remote sensing of the terrestrial carbon cycle. Third, we review the platforms/sensors, methods, findings, and challenges in remote sensing of carbon fluxes. The remote sensing data and techniques used to quantify carbon fluxes include vegetation indices, light use efficiency models, terrestrial biosphere models, data-driven (or machine learning) approaches, solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF), land surface temperature, and atmospheric inversions. Fourth, we review the platforms/sensors, methods, findings, and challenges in passive optical, microwave, and lidar remote sensing of biomass carbon stocks as well as remote sensing of soil organic carbon. Fifth, we review the progresses in remote sensing of disturbance impacts on the carbon cycle. Sixth, we also discuss the uncertainty and validation of the resulting carbon flux and stock estimates. Finally, we offer a forward-looking perspective and insights for future research and directions in remote sensing of the terrestrial carbon cycle. Remote sensing is anticipated to play an increasingly important role in carbon cycling studies in the future.

However, EC measurements represent an integrated flux over their footprint area, which usually differs from respective model grids or remote sensing pixels. Quantifying the uncertainties of scale mismatch associated with gridded flux estimates by upscaling single EC tower NEP measurements to the grid scale is an important but not yet fully investigated issue due to limited data availability as well as knowledge of flux variability at the grid scale. The Heihe Watershed Allied Telemetry Experimental Research (HiWATER) Multi-Scale Observation Experiment on Evapotranspiration (MUSOEXE) built a flux observation matrix that includes 17 EC towers within a 5 km _ 5 km area in a heterogeneous agricultural landscape in northwestern China, providing an unprecedented opportunity to evaluate the uncertainty of upscaling due to spatial representative differences at the grid scale. Based on the HiWATER-MUSOEXE data, this study evaluated the spatial representativeness and uncertainty of EC CO2 flux measurements for upscaling to the grid scale using a scheme that combines a footprint model and a model-data fusion method. The results revealed the large spatial variability of gross primary productivity (GPP), ecosystem respiration (Re), and NEP within the study site during the growing season from 10 June to 14 September 2012. The variability of fluxes led to high variability in the representativeness of single EC towers for grid-scale NEP. The systematic underestimations of a single EC tower may reach 92(±11)%, 30(±11)%, and 165(±150)% and the overestimations may reach 25(±14)%, 20(±13)%, and 40(±33)% for GPP, Re, and NEP, respectively. This finding suggests that remotely sensed NEP at the global scale (e.g., MODIS products) should not be validated against single EC tower data in the case of heterogeneous surfaces. Any systematic bias should be addressed before upscaling EC data to grid scale. Otherwise, most of the systematic bias may be propagated to grid scale due to the scale dependence of model parameters. A systematic bias greater than 20% of the EC measurements can be corrected effectively using four indicators proposed in this study. These results will contribute to the understanding of spatial representativeness of EC towers within a heterogeneous landscape, to upscaling carbon fluxes from the footprint to the grid scale, to the selection of the location of EC towers, and to the reduction in the bias of NEP products by using an improved parameterization scheme of remote-sensing driven models, such as VPRM.",,,,,,,,,,,Elsevier,,,,,,,2016,230,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Agricultural and Forest Meteorology,,114-127,Q1

In the present study remote sensing based gross primary production (GPP) estimations were evaluated using data from a tall eddy-covariance flux tower, located over a heterogeneous agricultural landscape in Hungary. Four different methods were used to simulate 8-day mean GPP for the tower site based on the MOD17 light use efficiency model. Additionally, we present a novel approach for model validation to exploit the advantage of footprint size similarity between remote sensing and the hourly eddy covariance signal measured at the tall tower. Besides using footprint information for the model validation we performed downscaling of MOD17 using 250 m resolution MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) dataset in order to address land use heterogeneity. The results showed that GPP was underestimated by MOD17 especially in years with average precipitation during the growing season, while model performance was better during dry years. Our downscaling technique significantly improved agreement between the MOD17 model results and the eddy covariance measurements (modeling efficiency (ME) increased from 0.783 to 0.884, root mean square error (RMSE) decreased from 1.095 g C m_2 day_1 to 0.815 g C m_2 day_1), although GPP remained underestimated (bias decreased from _0.680 g C m_2 day_1 to _0.426 g C m_2 day_1). Model evaluation results suggest that model performance should be optimally evaluated using RMSE, index of agreement (IA), ME and bias.

The study area was located in southeast Madagascar, in a region that exhibits very high rate of deforestation and which is characterized by both humid and dry climates. We estimated SOC stock on 0.1 ha plots for 95 different locations in a 43,000 ha reference area covering both dry and humid conditions and representing different land cover including natural forest, cropland, pasture and fallows. We used the Random Forest algorithm to find out the environmental factors explaining the spatial distribution of SOC. We then predicted SOC stocks for two soil layers at 30 cm and 100 cm over a wider area of 395,000 ha. By changing the soil and vegetation indices derived from remote sensing images we were able to produce SOC maps for 1991 and 2011. Those estimates and their related uncertainties where combined in a post-processing step to map estimates of significant SOC variations and we finally compared the SOC change map with published deforestation maps. Results show that the geologic variables, precipitation, temperature, and soil-vegetation status were strong predictors of SOC distribution at regional scale. We estimated an average net loss of 10.7% and 5.2% for the 30 cm and the 100 cm layers respectively for deforested areas in the humid area.

Today, electromagnetic wavelengths in use range from the ultraviolet to microwave portions of the spectrum, enabling advanced applications such as light detection and ranging (LiDAR), fluorescence spectroscopy, and thermal spectroscopy, along with more traditional applications in the visible and near infrared portions of the spectrum. Spectral bandwidth has decreased dramatically with the advent of hyperspectral remote sensing, allowing improved analysis of specific compounds, molecular interactions, crop stress, and crop biophysical or biochemical characteristics. A variety of spectral indices now exist for various precision agriculture applications, rather than a focus on only normalised difference vegetation indices. Spatial resolution of aerial and satellite remote sensing imagery has improved from 100's of m to sub-metre accuracy, allowing evaluation of soil and crop properties at fine spatial resolution at the expense of increased data storage and processing requirements.

However, in order to be able to fully exploit data from forthcoming hyperspectral satellites, information on several issues related to sensor spatial and spectral resolution and range, as well as on calibration and validation issues, is still required.
In the present study, images acquired over bare soil in Central Italy by airborne MIVIS (430–1270 nm; spatial resolution: 4.8 m) and space-borne CHRIS-PROBA (415–1050 nm; spatial resolution: 17 m), were used to explore methods for the quantitative estimation of soil texture. Extensive soil sampling was carried out for the determination of soil particle size fractions. Soil texture was related to the spectral signature of corresponding CHRIS or MIVIS pixels. The spectral behavior of the soil samples was also examined in the laboratory, by using a spectroradiometer in the 400–2500 nm range. Spectra were used to calibrate prediction models for the estimation of clay, silt and sand, through partial least-square regression (PLSR). The impact of several factors on the accuracy of estimation of soil texture was studied, such as spectral range and resolution, the effect of varying soil moisture and the geolocation error. The modality of setting up the calibration and validation data sets was also investigated, by employing either randomly selected or spatially separated datasets. The validity of the models was assessed from several statistics, such as bias, root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) and ratio of performance to deviation (RPD).
Results from laboratory data show the importance of SWIR bands to estimate clay, silt and sand fractions. The tests with remote sensing data show a sufficient accuracy of prediction (RPD > 1.4) for clay and sand using both MIVIS and CHRIS-PROBA data, but results vary in response to the modality of setting up the calibration and validation sets. Results were found to be sensitive to the difference in support between point and pixel data and to the geometric registration error, especially for MIVIS data. When using a 3 _ 3 window instead of a single pixel, RPD values as high as 1.85 for MIVIS and 1.75 for CHRIS were found.
Despite the lack of SWIR bands and a lower spatial resolution, CHRIS did show a comparable potential to MIVIS in terms of accuracy and of prediction ability. This was probably a consequence of the conditions in which the images were acquired, in which the pattern of soil moisture in the field might have played a role in the discrimination of soil texture.",,,,,,,,,,,Elsevier,,,,,,,2013,197,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Geoderma,,17-26,Q1

The results showed that the use of a mixture of sensors proved more effective to model and map soil properties than single sensors. The use of radar Sentinel-1 data proved useful for all soil properties, improving the prediction capability of models with only optical bands. The use of MODIS time series provided stronger relationships than the use of temporal snapshots. The results showed good validation statistics with a RMSE below 20% of the range for all considered soil properties. The RMSE improved from previous studies including only MODIS sensor and using a coarser prediction grid. The performance of the models was similar to previous studies at regional, national or continental scale. A mix of optical and radar data proved useful to map soil properties along the profile. The produced maps of soil properties describing both lateral and vertical variability, with associated uncertainty, are important for further modelling and management of soil resources and ecosystem services. Coupled with further data the soil properties maps could be used to assess soil functions and therefore conditions and suitability of soils for a range of purposes.",,,,,,,,,,,Elsevier,,,,,,,2017,579,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Science of the Total Environment,,1094-1110,Q1

Reflectance spectroscopy has proven to be a promising technique for SOC quantification in the laboratory and increasingly from air- and spaceborne platforms, where hyperspectral imagery provides great potential for mapping SOC on larger scales with regular updates. When applied on larger scales, soil prediction accuracy decreases due to the inhomogeneity of samples. In this paper, we examined if spectral clustering of the LUCAS EU-wide topsoil database is successful without using other covariates than the spectral database and can improve SOC model performance compared to a reference model that was calibrated on the whole database without clustering. Different clustering methodologies were tested, including a k-means clustering based on principal component analysis or based on spectral feature variables, combined with partial least squares regression (PLSR) models, and a clustering based on a local PLSR approach which builds a different multivariate model for each sample to be predicted. Furthermore, in order to allow for subsequent application to hyperspectral remote sensing data, atmospheric water wavelengths were removed from the analyses. The local PLSR approach achieved best results and was additionally applied to LUCAS spectra resampled to the upcoming hyperspectral EnMAP sensor which led to good results: R2_=_0.66, RMSEP_=_5.78_g_kg_1 and RPIQ_=_1.93. The k-means clustering approach showed slightly better results than the reference model. Overall, our results showed similar performances for SOC prediction models compared to other approaches using PLSR with a larger spectral range and other soil parameters as covariates. This study shows that (i) it is possible to transfer the local PLSR approach onto a wavelengths reduced spectral library and to predict estimations of SOC at low-cost with reasonable accuracy based on large scale soil databases; and (ii) that the local regression approach is a valuable tool for SOC prediction models based solely on spectral data without the use of other soil covariates.",,,,,,,,,,,Elsevier,,,,,,,2019,353,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Geoderma,,297-307,Q1

In eroding agricultural landscapes, C gets transported from erosional to depositional landscape elements forming a heterogeneous pattern in quantity and quality of the distributed carbon. At present, methods and research to characterize this horizontal and vertical variability are either limited to local slope scales or, if applied to larger scales, to surface soil horizons with large uncertainties when extrapolated to deeper layers. In this study, we used soil profile data collected in two zones of differing soil texture (loam and clay-rich soils) in Luxembourg, to calibrate a linear mixed-effect model to predict the 3D soil C stock distribution on a regional scale for cropping systems using a set of spatially-explicit hydrologic, climatic, pedologic and geomorphologic variables. We demonstrate that due to a high spatial variability of C stocks it is mandatory to consider various environmental processes to predict C accurately on a regional scale, especially in deeper soil layers, and to avoid simple depth extrapolation of topsoil C data as has been done earlier in flat landscapes. Using estimates of topsoil C contents derived from hyperspectral remote sensing, we predict spatial patterns of C stocks for cropland on a regional scale and provide new insights into the spatial heterogeneity of soil C storage covering a large area. The variability of C stocks in the two texture zones expressed as values larger or smaller than the mean ± standard deviation is hereby lower in the loam zone (26.2%) than in the clay zone (38.7%). We estimate a mean C stock (to 100 cm soil depth) of 9.4 ± 3.1 kg/m2 for the clay-rich soils and 11.3 ± 2.4 kg/m2 for loamy soils.

The SOC and SIC densities up to 100 cm depth or paralithic contact (whichever is shallower) were estimated for 1198 soil samples located across India using a stratified random sampling that integrated land use, soil, topography and agro-ecological regions. Using Random forests (RF) based spatial prediction procedure with climatic, land cover, rock type, soil type, multi-year NDVI, irrigation status as independent input variables, models for predicting carbon density at 250 m spatial resolution were developed. For modelling with RF algorithm, about 898 soil profile observations (75% observations) were used, while the rest of 300 (25% of total observations) were used for validation. It was observed that the data distribution of sample points don't have significant influence on RF model predictions. The relationship between observed and predicted values was characterized by Mean Squared Deviation (MSD) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) parameters. The SOC, SIC and total soil carbon pool size of India has been estimated at 22.72 ± 0.93 Pg,12.83 ± 1.35 Pg and 35.55 ± 1.87 Pg, respectively, which are comparable to previous studies while providing first spatially explicit 250 m map of their distribution.

245,"Dvorakova, Klara; Shi, Pu; Limbourg, Quentin; van Wesemael, Bas; ",,Soil organic carbon mapping from remote sensing: the effect of crop residues,Remote Sensing,remote sensing,,,,,"Since the onset of agriculture, soils have lost their organic carbon to such an extent that the soil functions of many croplands are threatened. Hence, there is a strong demand for mapping and monitoring critical soil properties and in particular soil organic carbon (SOC). Pilot studies have demonstrated the potential for remote sensing techniques for SOC mapping in croplands. It has, however, been shown that the assessment of SOC may be hampered by the condition of the soil surface. While growing vegetation can be readily detected by means of the well-known Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), the distinction between bare soil and crop residues is expressed in the shortwave infrared region (SWIR), which is only covered by two broad bands in Landsat or Sentinel-2 imagery. Here we tested the effect of thresholds for the Cellulose Absorption Index (CAI), on the performance of SOC prediction models for cropland soils. Airborne Prism Experiment (APEX) hyperspectral images covering an area of 240 km2 in the Belgian Loam Belt were used together with a local soil dataset. We used the partial least square regression (PLSR) model to estimate the SOC content based on 104 georeferenced calibration samples (NDVI < 0.26), firstly without setting a CAI threshold, and obtained a satisfactory result (coefficient of determination (R2) = 0.49, Ratio of Performance to Deviation (RPD) = 1.4 and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) = 2.13 g kgC_1 for cross-validation). However, a cross comparison of the estimated SOC values to grid-based measurements of SOC content within three fields revealed a systematic overestimation for fields with high residue cover. We then tested different CAI thresholds in order to mask pixels with high residue cover. The best model was obtained for a CAI threshold of 0.75 (R2 = 0.59, RPD = 1.5 and RMSE = 1.75 g kgC_1 for cross-validation). These results reveal that the purity of the pixels needs to be assessed aforehand in order to produce reliable SOC maps. The Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR2) index based on the SWIR bands of the MSI Sentinel 2 sensor extracted from images collected nine days before the APEX flight campaign correlates well with the CAI index of the APEX imagery. However, the NBR2 index calculated from Sentinel 2 images under moist conditions is poorly correlated with residue cover. This can be explained by the sensitivity of the NBR2 index to both soil moisture and residues. ",,,,,,,,,,,MDPI,,,,,,,2020,12,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Remote Sensing,12.0,1913,Q1

Precise digital soil maps can help to till agricultural fields with more accuracy, greater cost-efficiency and better environmental protection. In the present study, the laboratory analysis of sand, silt, clay and soil organic carbon (SOC) content was combined with hyperspectral image data to estimate the distribution of soil texture and SOC across an agricultural area. The aim was to identify regions with similar soil properties and derive uniform soil regions based on this information. Soil parameter data and corresponding laboratory spectra were used to calibrate cross-validated (leave-one-out) partial least squares regression (PLSR) models, resulting in robust models for sand (R2 = 0.77, root-mean-square error (RMSE) = 5.37) and SOC (R2 = 0.89, RMSE = 0.27), as well as moderate models for silt (R2 = 0.62, RMSE = 5.46) and clay (R2 = 0.53, RMSE = 2.39). The regression models were applied to Airborne Imaging Spectrometer for Applications DUAL (aisaDUAL) hyperspectral image data to spatially estimate the concentration of these parameters. Afterwards, a decision tree, based on the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) soil texture classification scheme, was developed to determine the soil texture for each pixel of the hyperspectral airborne data. These soil texture regions were further refined with the spatial SOC estimations. The developed method is useful to identify spatial regions with similar soil properties, which can provide a vital information source for an adapted treatment of agricultural fields in terms of the necessary amount of fertilizers or water. The approach can also be adapted to wider regions with a larger sample size to create detailed digital soil maps (DSMs). Further, the presented method should be applied to future hyperspectral satellite missions like Environmental Mapping and Analysis Program (EnMap) and Hyperspectral Infrared Imager (HyspIRI) to cover larger areas in shorter time intervals.

247,"Dvorakova, Klara; Heiden, Uta; van Wesemael, Bas; ",,Sentinel-2 exposed soil composite for soil organic carbon prediction,Remote Sensing,remote sensing,,,,,"Pilot studies have demonstrated the potential of remote sensing for soil organic carbon (SOC) mapping in exposed croplands. However, the use of remote sensing for SOC prediction is often hindered by disturbing factors at the soil surface, such as photosynthetic active and non-photosynthetic active vegetation, variation in soil moisture or surface roughness. With the increasing amount of freely available satellite data, recent studies have focused on stabilizing the soil reflectance by building image composites. These composites tend to minimize the disturbing effects by applying sets of criteria. Here, we aim to develop a robust method that allows selecting Sentinel-2 (S-2) pixels with minimal influence of the following disturbing factors: crop residues, surface roughness and soil moisture. We selected all S-2 cloud-free images covering the Belgian Loam Belt from January 2019 to December 2020 (in total 36 images). We then built nine exposed soil composites based on four sets of criteria: (1) lowest Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR2), (2) Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) < 0.25, (3–5) NDVI < 0.25 and NBR2 < threshold, (6) the ‘greening-up’ period of a crop and (7–9) the ‘greening-up’ period of a crop and NBR2 < threshold. The ‘greening-up’ period was selected based on the NDVI timeline, where ‘greening-up’ is considered as the last date of acquisition where the soil is exposed (NDVI < 0.25) before the crop develops (NDVI > 0.25). We then built a partial least square regression (PLSR) model with 10-fold cross-validation to estimate the SOC content based on 137 georeferenced calibration samples on the nine composites. We obtained non-satisfactory results (R2 < 0.30, RMSE > 2.50 g C kg–1, and RPD < 1.4, n > 68) for all composites except for the composite in the ‘greening-up’ stage with a NBR2 < 0.07 (R2 = 0.54 ± 0.12, RPD = 1.68 ± 0.45 and RMSE = 2.09 ± 0.39 g C kg–1, n = 49). Hence, the ‘greening-up’ method combined with a strict NBR2 threshold allows selecting the purest exposed soil pixels suitable for SOC prediction. The limit of this method might be its coverage of the total cropland area, which in a two-year period reached 62%, compared to 95% coverage if only the NDVI threshold is applied. ",,,,,,,,,,,MDPI,,,,,,,2021,13,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Remote Sensing,9.0,1791,Q1

Nowadays, most monitoring and data collection systems are based upon a combination of ground-based measurements, manned airborne sensors, and satellite observations. These data are utilized in describing both small- and large-scale processes, but have spatiotemporal constraints inherent to each respective collection system. Bridging the unique spatial and temporal divides that limit current monitoring platforms is key to improving our understanding of environmental systems. In this context, Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) have considerable potential to radically improve environmental monitoring. UAS-mounted sensors offer an extraordinary opportunity to bridge the existing gap between field observations and traditional air- and space-borne remote sensing, by providing high spatial detail over relatively large areas in a cost-effective way and an entirely new capacity for enhanced temporal retrieval. As well as showcasing recent advances in the field, there is also a need to identify and understand the potential limitations of UAS technology. For these platforms to reach their monitoring potential, a wide spectrum of unresolved issues and application-specific challenges require focused community attention. Indeed, to leverage the full potential of UAS-based approaches, sensing technologies, measurement protocols, postprocessing techniques, retrieval algorithms, and evaluation techniques need to be harmonized.

The latter provides ecosystem services (ES), of which carbon sequestration is one. Estimation of aboveground carbon stocks in NPPV has incentivized carbon storage within the agricultural landscape. Remote sensing has significantly improved resolution of earth imaging and automated assessment of these often small, fragmented NPPV parcels. Novel methods of assessment have also been motivated by changes in land policy and concomitant loss of NPPV carbon stocks. To characterize and evaluate the carbon storage potential of agricultural NPPV in Southwestern British Columbia, we utilized a compliment of remote sensing and secondary data sources. Object- and pixel-oriented classification with RapidEye imagery enabled mapping of NPPV at 92.9% accuracy, covering 33.2% of the landscape. NPPV provided 3.34 Mt C in aboveground biomass, 38.4% of which was composed of fragments unlikely to be identified through coarser satellite imagery. Using secondary soil surveys and sub-regional characteristics, indicators of agricultural expansion suggested that small parcels of NPPV were more likely to persist on active farmland, while large forest stands (' 9 hectares) were less likely to occur alongside lands already in production and often located on lands amenable to farming. Were these large contiguous tracks of NPPV cleared for production agriculture, we estimate that 0.98‚Äì1.86 Mt of stored carbon could potentially be released. These stands represent important carbon sinks and their retention could be incentivized through ES services remuneration and conservation programs. ¬© 2020, Springer Nature B.V.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2020,94,5,,10.1007/s10457-020-00514-5,,,,57205377184;23986977300;23393281500;,,1947.0,1958.0,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85087077555&doi=10.1007%2fs10457-020-00514-5&partnerID=40&md5=92dc2274bcf0e96706179d31a8f9ada6,aboveground biomass; automation; carbon sequestration; carbon sink; conservation management; ecosystem service; perennial plant; remote sensing; satellite imagery; stand structure; temperate environment; vegetation cover; British Columbia; Canada,English,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85087077555,,,,Q2

A multitude of satellite sensors at varying spatial and spectral resolution brings a possibility to use remotely sensed data for regional and global GPP estimation. More work is still needed to develop algorithms for GPP estimation applicable to multiple, if not all, vegetation types, phenological phases, and environmental conditions. This study employed neural networks (NN), multiple linear regressions (MLR), and vegetation indices (VI) to develop algorithms for GPP estimation based solely on remotely sensed data in two crops, maize (Zea mays L.) and soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.], with contrasting canopy architectures, leaf structures, and photosynthetic pathways. The focus of the study was to devise algorithms not requiring re-parameterization for different crop species. Data used in the models included in situ hyperspectral reflectance and satellite surface reflectance products. For the tested NN, MLR, and VI algorithms, the bands selected to obtain minimal errors in maize and soybean combined were mainly located in red edge and near infrared (NIR) spectral regions. For both in situ reflectance and satellite surface reflectance, a NN estimated GPP with normalized root mean square errors (NRMSE) below 14 and 18.7%, respectively, and VI using bands in red edge and NIR with NRMSE 15.6 and 20.4%, respectively. The results showed that the models based on the red edge and NIR bands may facilitate accurate assessments of crop GPP at multiple scales, from close range to satellite platforms.","[Peng, Yi] Wuhan Univ, Sch Remote Sensing & Informat Engn, Wuhan 430079, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Peng, Yi] Wuhan Univ, Lab Remote Sensing Crop Phenotyping, Wuhan 430079, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Kira, Oz; Sun, Ying] Cornell Univ, Soil & Crop Sci, Sch Integrat Plant Sci, Coll Agr & Life Sci, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Nguy-Robertson, Anthony; Suyker, Andrew; Gitelson, Anatoly A.] Univ Nebraska, Sch Nat Resources, Lincoln, NE 68583 USA; [Arkebauer, Timothy] Univ Nebraska, Dept Agron & Hort, Lincoln, NE 68583 USA; [Gitelson, Anatoly A.] Israel Inst Technol Technion, IL-3200003 Haifa, Israel",,"kira, oz/0000-0002-1620-2323; Sun, Ying/0000-0002-9819-1241","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab AmeriFlux Data Management Program; Carbon Sequestration Program, University of Nebraska-Lincoln Agricultural Research Division; U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Science; Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station; Hatch Act through the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture [1002649]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41771381]; BARD, the United States-Israel Binational Agricultural Research and Development Fund, Vaadia-BARD Postdoctoral Fellowship Award [FI-576-18]","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab AmeriFlux Data Management Program; Carbon Sequestration Program, University of Nebraska-Lincoln Agricultural Research Division; U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Science(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station; Hatch Act through the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); BARD, the United States-Israel Binational Agricultural Research and Development Fund, Vaadia-BARD Postdoctoral Fellowship Award","The US-Ne1, US-Ne2, and US-Ne3 AmeriFlux sites are supported by the Lawrence Berkeley National Lab AmeriFlux Data Management Program and by the Carbon Sequestration Program, University of Nebraska-Lincoln Agricultural Research Division.

When SOC changes is estimated with legacy data, the use of soil samples collected in different plots (i.e., non-paired data) may lead to biased results. In the present work, N = 302 georeferenced soil samples were selected from a regional (Sicily, south of Italy) soil database. An operational sampling approach was developed to spot SOC concentration changes from 1994 to 2017 in the same plots at the 0-30 cm soil depth and tested. Results The measurements were conducted after computing the minimum number of samples needed to have a reliable estimate of SOC variation after 23 years. By applying an effect size based methodology, 30 out of 302 sites were resampled in 2017 to achieve a power of 80%, and an alpha = 0.05. A Wilcoxon test applied to the variation of SOC from 1994 to 2017 suggested that there was not a statistical difference in SOC concentration after 23 years (Z = - 0.556; 2-tailed asymptotic significance = 0.578). In particular, only 40% of resampled sites showed a higher SOC concentration than in 2017. Conclusions This finding contrasts with a previous SOC concentration increase that was found in 2008 (75.8% increase when estimated as differences of 2 models built with non-paired data), when compared to 1994 observed data (Z = - 9.119; 2-tailed asymptotic significance < 0.001). This suggests that the use of legacy data to estimate SOC concentration dynamics requires soil resampling in the same locations to overcome the stochastic model errors. Further experiment is needed to identify the percentage of the sites to resample in order to align two legacy datasets in the same area.","[Schillaci, Calogero; Perego, Alessia; Acutis, Marco] Univ Milan, Dept Agr & Environm Sci, I-20133 Milan, Italy; [Saia, Sergio] Univ Pisa, Dept Vet Sci, Via Piagge 2, I-56129 Pisa, Italy; [Lipani, Aldo] Univ Coll London UCL, Dept Civil Environm & Geomat Engn, Gower St, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Zaccone, Claudio] Univ Verona, Dept Biotechnol, Str Le Grazie 15, I-37134 Verona, Italy",,"Zaccone, Claudio/0000-0003-4391-354X; Lipani, Aldo/0000-0002-3643-6493; Schillaci, Calogero/0000-0001-7689-5697; Saia, Sergio/0000-0001-5465-8500; Acutis, Marco/0000-0002-1576-8261", [774234],,"The work is partially founded with the H2020 program Landsupport, ID: 774234.",,95.0,0.0,0.0,BMC,1750-0680,,,CARBON BAL MANAGE,Carbon Balanc.

Validated with a comparison of seasonal and annual variations over 5 years, the NEP estimations bore good agreement with the measurements. In regional-scale analyses, we targeted all rice paddy fields in Japan from January 2001 to December 2009. Before and after the model enhancement, the NEP showed very different spatial variations and absolute values, suggesting that the most effective improvements were the introduction of harvest and soil oxidation-reduction processes. In annual anomaly analyses covering a 9-year period, the NEP was found to be negative in 2003 and 2006 (-0.11 and -0.25. TgC/year) and positive in 2004 and 2007 (+0.02 and +0.21. TgC/year). We found that the negative values were caused by decreases in solar radiation and air temperature and the positive values were caused by increases in these two parameters and precipitation. In response to the NEP, our obtained harvested grain biomass values in 2003 and 2006 were lower than usual. The results were in good agreement with the results from reports of the Japan Meteorological Agency and the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries. ¬© 2012 Elsevier B.V.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2012,247,,,10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2012.08.016,,,,35339913600;55504712200;55504939400;24177424900;8965054000;7006584586;7403892030;7102680527;7004074578;35509463200;24178270500;,,175.0,189.0,,6.0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84870226168&doi=10.1016%2fj.ecolmodel.2012.08.016&partnerID=40&md5=b4d8c1f097b2b8c93b6fce4498e22ef0,BEAMS; Biosphere models; Carbon cycles; NEP; Rice paddy; Agricultural engineering; Agriculture; Remote sensing; Sun; Biospherics; biosphere; carbon cycle; net ecosystem production; paddy field; precipitation (climatology); remote sensing; rice; solar radiation; spatiotemporal analysis; Japan,English,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84870226168,,,,Q2

In this study we used a sample set included in the Finnish national soil monitoring network (n = 125) to determine the SOC stock and its vertical distribution in Finnish agricultural mineral soils using fixed depth (FD) and equivalent soil mass (ESM) methods. Further, we explored the within-field variation in SOC stock and minimum sample size in the context of SOC sequestration. Boreal agricultural mineral soils were found to be rich in SOC. The average SOC stock ranged between 8.4 and 9.8 kg m(-2)in the top 30 cm depending on cropping system and soil type. Cultivation of perennial crops tended to enrich the C close to the soil surface in comparison to dominantly annual crops, which exhibited a less steep C gradient with depth. The commonly used van Bemmelen factor of 1.724 to convert results of loss on ignition to SOC was found to be appropriate for coarse-textured Finnish agricultural soils. However, the results showed that in clay-rich soils, it is critical to take into account the structural water bound in clay particles to avoid overestimation of the SOC content. The study also demonstrated that the minimum sample size required to detect the change of 0.1 kg C m(-2)at field level is typically several hundreds. Therefore empirical soil sampling is not at all cost-effective enough for verifying the changes in SOC stocks with regard to compensation of C sequestration for farmers. Thus, alternative verification methods, such as SOC modelling in combination with field-level data collected, for example, using remote sensing should be developed further.

Results demonstrate a significant decline in forest area (21,034 ha) at an annual rate of 0.56% from 1973 to 2015. The total WH was 24.84 million m(3) (0.23 million m(3) yr(-1)) between 1908 and 2015.

The present results indicate that under the existing FCC and WH harvest scenario, the forests are acting as a net source of 0.29 million Mg C yr(-1). Agriculture expansion and the heavy dependency of local communities on the forest's resources, exclusion of conservation and local communities from forest management, insufficient monitoring, and weak law-enforcement were the striking drivers of FCC, WH, and their related emissions.

The present study proposes for the first time a Digital Soil Mapping (DSM) initiative to map SOC stocks in Tunisian topsoils (0‚Äì30 cm) at 100 m resolution, using a Quantile Regression Forest (QRF) algorithm, a range of environmental covariates, and a national database of 1540 SOC stock profiles. Our results provided a revised assessment of the SOC stock on the Tunisian territory at 391Tg C in the first 30 cm of soil profile, i.e. an average of 2.53 kg m-2. The map of SOC stocks outperformed global DSM products such as SoilGrids 2.0 in both R2 (0.44 vs. 0.15) and RMSE (1.94 vs. 2.52 kg m‚àí2) and can be used as a benchmark against changes of land use and climate. The importance of the environmental covariates tested indicates the major role of bioclimatic data and, to a lesser extent, remote sensing images and topography-related variables. Our study did not show a significant added value of using additional covariates in relation to nationally available variables or the SOC map predicted by SoilGrids2.0. Finally, our results showed that increasing the quality and quantity of soil profile observations is most likely the best way to improve the future SOC map, starting with the northern region of Tunisia, which has the highest SOC stock predictions and uncertainties in the country. An alternative way would be the exploration of new covariates through sub-national approaches. ¬© 2022 Elsevier B.V.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2022,30,,,10.1016/j.geodrs.2022.e00561,,,,57794388400;57794945900;57794112800;57794946000;56215674300;,e00561,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85133843894&doi=10.1016%2fj.geodrs.2022.e00561&partnerID=40&md5=8f4c65972d9d05391c37c9c72b93221c,,English,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85133843894,,,,Q2

The Land Surface Temperature (LST) derived from thermal infrared wavelength can be related with soil properties, particularly texture. The availability of LST data on a regular basis, with good spatial resolution to cover extensive agricultural regions and also integrated with reflectance data enhances its use in soil attributes mapping. The objectives of this research were to verify the relationships between soil attributes texture and organic carbon (OC) with the remote sensing (RS) products LST and surface reflectance and perform maps of classes of such attributes based on these variables. The study area (473 ha) is located near the municipality of Barra Bonita, southeast of S√£o Paulo State, Brazil. A regular sampling grid with 100 √ó 100 m2 and with sampling density of one sample per hectare was established on the study site, from where surface samples (0‚Äì0.2 m) were collected via auger and had their contents determined by wet chemistry analysis. Images from Landsat 5 were obtained for extraction of LST and reflectance. The algorithm Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) was applied for soil attributes mapping using 55 toposequences samples and considering (a) three LST images; (b) only reflectance from one Landsat scene and (c) reflectance + LST from the same scene as in (b). Besides this, maps were performed using only one LST image with a histogram-based classification. The weighted kappa (kw) was calculated with validation samples and indicated the classification accuracy. Mapping of texture and OC through SAM algorithm produced better results than the classification of LST, regardless of the variables being considered. For both attributes, the best map was produced using reflectance + LST, with substantial agreement for texture and moderate for OC. The use of LST for mapping soil attributes concomitantly with reflectance spectra improved the mapping accuracy. ¬© 2018 Elsevier B.V.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2018,14,,,10.1016/j.geodrs.2018.e00174,,,,57189301012;6603846580;,e00174,,,,13.0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85047085549&doi=10.1016%2fj.geodrs.2018.e00174&partnerID=40&md5=827366fde7af2c85a9b586bd04acfb90,,English,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85047085549,,,,Q2

This article studied the quantitative relationship between SOM and soil colour using a digital camera, which is relatively inexpensive and easy to operate, as a portable tool for obtaining colour information of the soil surface. The results show that mixed samples with different soil particle sizes reduce the noise of the image and are more suitable than uniform soil samples for predicting the SOM. Among the three bands of red, green, and blue (RGB), the red band had the best correlation with SOM, and its reciprocal correlation coefficient (r) reached 0.75. The reciprocal regression model of the RGB colour model provided good prediction results for mixed soil samples, with a coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.76 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.55, and the validation result had an excellent predictive ability (R-val(2) = 0.85 and RMSEval = 0.53). The single-variation predictive model of CIELa*b* colour space model through transformation of the RGB colour space model performed well.

Data from Landsat 8 OLI were used to assess the correlation between spectral reflectance and different vegetation indices on one side, and aboveground biomass (AGB) derived from ground measurements on the other. AGB and CS (ton ha(-1)) were estimated using traditional destructive methods of standard sampling techniques and allometric equations developed in a previous study for date palms in the area. The relationships between the estimated AGB and parameters derived from remote sensing (RS) data were tested using single and multiple linear regression analysis. The results indicated a significant correlation with certain RS parameters. For mature palms class alone (>10 years), the correlation with single bands was only significant with SWIR1 and SWIR2 while the correlation was significant with all tested VI's except for TCB vegetation index. A combination of bands R, SWIR1, and SWIR2 improved the determination of this class to a coefficient of determination (R-2) value of 0.961. However, for the medium and young age classes (10-5 and less than 5 years), the correlation was not significant (with the exception of SWIR1 and TCB index for medium class), where the use of higher spatial resolution can be a good alternative. On the other hand, for mixed ages (young, medium and mature palms), the strongest correlations were found using SWIR2 single band and the SR vegetation index; having R-2 values of 0.753 and 0.871, respectively. The R-2 was improved to 0.952 by using stepwise multiple regression combining DVI, NDI, and RVI vegetation indices. Finally, results obtained showed that CS represented 53.87% of the total AGB in date palms. Subsequently, the average amount of carbon stock (CS) for both mature and mixed classes was calculated at 15.81 and 10.3 ton ha(-1) respectively.","[Issa, Salem; Dahy, Basam] United Arab Emirates Univ, Dept Geol, Al Ain, U Arab Emirates; [Saleous, Nazmi] United Arab Emirates Univ, Dept Geog, Al Ain, U Arab Emirates; [Ksiksi, Taoufik] United Arab Emirates Univ, Dept Biol, Al Ain, U Arab Emirates",,"Ksiksi, TS/0000-0003-2598-1530; issa, salem/0000-0003-1706-5532",United Arab Emirates University - Research Affairs [31S247],United Arab Emirates University - Research Affairs,This work was supported by the United Arab Emirates University - Research Affairs [31S247].,,50.0,7.0,8.0,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,0143-1161,1366-5901,,INT J REMOTE SENS,Int.

This study examines the feasibility of two statistical learning algorithms, namely the least square support vector machine (LSSVM) and relevance vector machine (RVM), for identifying two contrasting tillage management practices using remote-sensing data. LSSVM is firmly based on statistical learning theory, whereas RVM is a probabilistic model where the training takes place in a Bayesian framework. Input to the LSSVM and RVM algorithms were reflectance values at different bandwidths and indices derived from Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) data. Ground-truth data for this study were collected from 72 commercial production fields in two counties located in the Texas High Plains of the south-central USA. Numerous LSSVM- and RVM-based tillage models were developed and evaluated for tillage classification accuracy. The percentage correct and kappa statistic were used for the evaluation. The results showed that the best LSSVM and RVM models included the use of TM band 5 or vegetation indices that involved TM band 5, indicating sensitivity of near-infrared reflectance of crop residue cover on the surface. This is consistent with other remote-sensing models reported in the literature. Overall classification accuracies of the best LSSVM and RVM models were 87.8 and 90.2%, respectively. The corresponding kappa statistics for those models were 0.75 and 0.80, respectively. Furthermore, comparison of the best LSSVM and RVM models with the published logistic regression-based tillage models developed with the same data indicated the superiority of the RVM model over LSSVM and logistic regression models in determining contrasting tillage practices with Landsat TM data.","[Gowda, Prasanna H.; Howell, Terry A.] USDA ARS, Conservat & Prod Res Lab, Bushland, TX 79012 USA; [Samui, Pijush] VIT Univ, Ctr Disaster Mitigat & Management, Vellore 632014, Tamil Nadu, India; [Oommen, Thomas] Michigan Technol Univ, Dept Geol & Min Engn & Sci, Houghton, MI 49931 USA; [Marek, Thomas H.] Texas A&M Univ, Texas AgriLife Res, Amarillo, TX 79106 USA; [Porter, Dana O.] Texas A&M Univ, Texas AgriLife Res, Lubbock, TX 79403 USA",,", pijush/0000-0001-7359-8718; samui, pijush/0000-0003-2906-6479",,,,,34.0,7.0,7.0,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,0143-1161,1366-5901,,INT J REMOTE SENS,Int.

Using satellite images of 1999 and 2011, land use and land use changes in the Kumrat valley KPK, Pakistan, were determined: a net decrease of 11.56 and 7.46 % occurred in forest and rangeland, while 100 % increase occurred in agriculture land (AL). Biomass in different land uses, forest land (FL), AL, and range land (RL) was determined by field inventory. From the biomass data, the amount of carbon was calculated, considering 50 % of the biomass as carbon. Soil carbon was also determined to a depth of 0-15 and 16-30 cm. The average carbon stocks (C stocks) in all land uses ranged from 28.62 +/- A 13.8 t ha(-1) in AL to 486.6 +/- A 32.4 t ha(-1) in pure Cedrus deodara forest. The results of the study confirmed that forest soil and vegetation stored the maximum amount of carbon followed by RL. Conversion of FL and RL to AL not only leads to total loss of about 56 % (from FL conversion) and 37 % (RL conversion) of soil carbon in the last decades but also the loss of a valuable carbon sink.

We present the results of an automated system used across 645 counties in the United States Corn Belt from 2005 to 2018, mapped at field-scale and summarized for distribution at aggregated scales. Large-scale mapping by OpTIS (Operational Tillage Information System), a software tool that analyzes remotely sensed data of agricultural land, provides trends of conservation tillage (defined as >30% residue cover), cover cropping, and crop rotations, while modeling by DNDC (Denitrification‚ÄìDecomposition), a process-based model of carbon and biogeochemistry in soil, provides estimates of the ecosystem outcomes associated with the changes in management practices mapped by OpTIS. Ground-truthing data acquired via OpTIS mobile, a roadside field-surveying app, were used for verification in 30 counties. OpTIS results for the Corn Belt show adoption of cover crops after planting corn and soy increased from 1% to 3% of the mapped area when comparing 2006 to 2018. Comparison of trends for conservation tillage use from 2006 to 2018 shows a slight decrease in conservation tillage adoption, from 46% to 44%. Results from DNDC show these soils sequestered soil organic carbon (SOC) at an area-weighted mean change in SOC (dSOC) rate of 161 kgC/ha/year. Comparatively, in a scenario modeled without the adoption of soil health management practices, the same soils would have lost SOC at an area-weighted rate of ‚àí65 kgC/ha/year. As many factors affect changes to SOC, including climate and initial SOC in soils, modeling counterfactual scenarios at the field scale demonstrates outcomes of current soil health management in comparison to regional management practices and best management practices, with respect to SOC sequestration. Regional trends in adoption rates of conservation agriculture and resulting soil health implications are of great use for a wide range of stakeholders. We demonstrate the capability of OpTIS remote sensing to deliver robust, large-scale, multi-sensor, ground-verified monitoring data of current and historical adoption of conservation practices, and of DNDC process-based modeling to provide assessments of the associated environmental outcomes across regions in U.S. cropland. ¬© 2020 by the authors.

Large-scale, high-resolution, and accurately quantified ET and GPP values are important fundamental data for freshwater resource management and help in understanding terrestrial carbon and water cycles in an arid region. In this study, the revised surface energy balance system (SEBS) model and MOD17 GPP algorithm were used to estimate daily ET and GPP at 100 m resolution based on multi-source satellite remote sensing data to obtain surface biophysical parameters and meteorological forcing data as input variables for the model in the midstream oasis area of the Heihe River Basin (HRB) from 2010 to 2016. Then, we further calculated the ecosystem water-use efficiency (WUE). We validated the daily ET, GPP, and WUE from ground observations at a crop oasis station and conducted spatial intercomparisons of monthly and annual ET, GPP, and WUE at the irrigation district and cropland oasis scales. The site-level evaluation results show that ET and GPP had better performance than WUE at the daily time scale. Specifically, the deviations in the daily ET, GPP, and WUE data compared with ground observations were small, with a root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute percent error (MAPE) of 0.75 mm/day and 26.59%, 1.13 gC/m2 and 36.26%, and 0.50 gC/kgH2O and 39.83%, respectively. The regional annual ET, GPP, and WUE varied from 300 to 700 mm, 200 to 650 gC/m2, and 0.5 to 1.0 gC/kgH2O, respectively, over the entire irrigation oasis area. It was found that annual ET and GPP were greater than 550 mm and 500 gC/m2, and annual oasis cropland WUE had strong invariability and was maintained at approximately 0.85 gC/kgH2O. The spatial intercomparisons from 2010 to 2016 revealed that ET had similar spatial patterns to GPP due to tightly coupled carbon and water fluxes. However, the WUE spatiotemporal patterns were slightly different from both ET and GPP, particularly in the early and late growing seasons for the oasis area. Our results demonstrate that spatial full coverage and reasonably fine spatiotemporal variation and variability could significantly improve our understanding of water-saving irrigation strategies and oasis agricultural water management practices in the face of water shortage issues. ¬© 2021 by the authors.

We used a meta-analysis of 427 soil C stock data pairs grouped into four main AF systems-alley cropping, windbreaks, silvopastures, and homegardens-and evaluated changes in AF and adjacent control cropland or pasture. Mean soil C stocks in AF (1-m depth) were 126 Mg C center dot ha(-1), which is 19% more than that in cropland or pasture. The highest C stocks in soil were in subtropical homegardens, AF with younger trees, and topsoil (0-20 cm).

Homegardens stored the highest C in both aboveground and belowground, especially in the subsoil (20-100 cm). Advantages of AF ecosystem services focusing on mechanisms of belowground C sequestration were analyzed. AF could store 5.3 x 10(9) Mg additional C in soil on 944 Mha globally, with most in the tropics and subtropics.

Recent developments in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) combined with miniaturized visible-near infrared spectrometers have enabled the rapid and low-cost field-scale SOC mapping. However, a field-specific spectrotransfer model is often needed for such UAV-based hyperspectral measurements, implying local sampling and model development are still required, and this hampers the widespread application of UAV-based methods. In this study, we aim to test to what extent SOC prediction models derived from an existing regional soil spectral library (SSL) can be applied to UAV-based hyperspectral data, without the need for additional field sampling. To this end, an UAV survey was conducted over a bare cropland within the Belgian Loam Belt for field-scale SOC mapping. We evaluated two calibration approaches, one based on local sampling and model development, and one where we capitalized on an existing (laboratory-based) regional SSL. For the local calibration approach, we obtained a good prediction performance with RMSE of 0.57 g kg(-1) and RPIQ of 2.35. For the regional model, a spectral alignment procedure was needed to resolve the discrepancy between UAV- and laboratory-based measurements.

These impacts are greatly understudied, especially in biodiversity rich mountains in East Africa. The objectives of this study were to: conduct a biophysical baseline of soil and land health; assess the effects of cultivation on soil organic carbon (SOC); and develop a map of SOC at high resolution to enable farm-scale targeting of management interventions. Biophysical field surveys were conducted in a 100 km 2 landscape near Lushoto, Tanzania, with composite soil samples collected from 160 sampling plots. Soil erosion prevalence was scored, trees were counted, and current and historic land use was recorded at each plot. The results of the study showed a decline in SOC as a result of cultivation, with cultivated plots (n = 105) having mean topsoil OC of 30.6 g kg(-1), while semi-natural plots (n = 55) had 71 g OC kg(-1) in topsoil. Cultivated areas were also less variable in SOC than seminatural systems. Prediction models were developed for the mapping of SOC based on RapidEye remote sensing data for January 2014, with good model performance (RMSEPcal = 8.0 g kg(-1); RMSEPval = 10.5 g kg(-1)) and a SOC map was generated for the study. Interventions will need to focus on practices that increase SOC in order to enhance productivity and resilience of the farming system, in general. The high-resolution maps can be used to spatially target interventions as well as for monitoring of changes in SOC.","[Winowiecki, Leigh] Ctr Int Agr Trop, Nairobi, Kenya; [Vagen, Tor-Gunnar] World Agroforestry Ctr ICRAF, Nairobi, Kenya; [Massawe, Boniface] Ohio State Univ, Sch Environm & Nat Resources, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Massawe, Boniface] Sokoine Univ Agr, Dept Soil Sci, Morogoro, Tanzania; [Jelinski, Nicolas A.] Univ Minnesota Twin Cities, Dept Soil Water & Climate, Minneapolis, MN USA; [Lyamchai, Charles; Sayula, George] Selian Agr Res Inst, Arusha, Tanzania; [Msoka, Elizabeth] Lushoto Dist Council, Lushoto, Tanzania",,"Vagen, Tor-Gunnar/0000-0002-8699-731X","CGIAR Research Program, Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS); International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD)","CGIAR Research Program, Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS)(CGIAR); International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD)","The fieldwork and soil analysis for the samples were funded by the CGIAR Research Program, Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS).

Remote sensing data (e.g., gross primary productivity, GPP; evapotranspiration, ET; and the normalized difference vegetation index, NDVI) were used to investigate the spatiotemporal characteristics of WUEc in the Loess Plateau during three periods: 1982‚Äì2015, 1982‚Äì2001, and 2001‚Äì2015. The results indicated that, first, the average and the trend of WUEc showed strong spatial heterogeneity over 1982‚Äì2015, a period that shows a strip distribution. The average value increased from the northwest to the southeast while the multiyear trend value decreased from the northwest to the southeast, and a positive slope prevailed (p &lt; 0.05). Second, statistically significant positive trends (p &lt; 0.001) in the annual mean WUEc for 1982‚Äì2015, with a value of 7.11 √ó 10‚àí3 g C kg‚àí1 H2O yr‚àí1, indicate that the rate of carbon sequestration in the agricultural ecosystem was faster than that of water loss. Finally, the GGP was conducive to the improvement of WUEc in this arid and semiarid area, with interannual trend values of WUEc from 1982 to 2001 of 4.26 √ó 10‚àí3 g C kg‚àí1 H2O, and 9.88 √ó 10‚àí3 g C kg‚àí1 H2O (p &lt; 0.05) after the GGP. Our analyses explored how the changes in WUEc after the GGP were more sensitive to the NDVIc (the subscript c stands for cropland) trends, which means that NDVIc was an important controller influencing GPPc and ETc tendency and thus further influencing WUEc in response to the GGP. This study contributes to a better understanding of the variations of agricultural carbon-water coupling and provides references and theories for the development of water-saving agriculture in an ecological restoration area. ¬© 2020 Elsevier Ltd",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021,121,,,10.1016/j.pce.2020.102975,,,,57211467564;57220932433;,102975,,,,10.0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85099148823&doi=10.1016%2fj.pce.2020.102975&partnerID=40&md5=1ffa9adb4f483106b8f7875ec7ba1274,Agricultural robots; Carbon; Ecosystems; Efficiency; Evapotranspiration; Landforms; Remote sensing; Sediments; Vegetation; Water conservation; Water supply; Agricultural ecosystems; Arid and semi-arid areas; Grain-to-green programs; Gross primary productivity; Normalized difference vegetation index; Spatio-temporal variation; Spatiotemporal characteristics; Water-saving agricultures; Grain (agricultural product); agricultural land; remote sensing; soil ecosystem; soil erosion; spatial variation; temporal variation; vegetation dynamics; water use efficiency; China; Loess Plateau,English,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85099148823,,,,Q2

The areas and structures of the land uses/covers changed greatly during this period. Specifically, the areas of cultivated, industrial and residential, and shrub land increased, particularly cultivated and shrub land. The areas of forestland, grassland, water bodies, and unused land decreased. SOC stocks in forestland, grassland and unused land decreased between 2000 and 2010. The total SOC stock for the forestland shrub land grassland and unused land was lower in 2010 than 2000. Land-use/cover conversion thus affected SOC stocks.

Within this region, Western Bahia stands out as a large producer of soy and cotton. There are no studies that quantify carbon stocks for different land uses and land cover types in Western Bahia, which hinders comprehension of the role of agricultural expansion in carbon dynamics and the development of sustainable agriculture policies. Here, we evaluate how the land use changes in this region have affected the carbon balance in the aboveground biomass (AGB), belowground biomass (BGB), and soil reservoirs. We collected soil samples for areas with different land uses and land cover types to estimate soil carbon stocks (SCS) and combined remote sensing results and modeling techniques to develop a historical reconstruction of spatial patterns of SCS, AGB, and BGB during the period 1990-2018. The replacement of areas from the forest formations class with pasture and rainfed agriculture reduced the 100 cm depth SCS (SCS100) by 37.3% (p = 0.031) and 30.3% (p = 0.053), respectively. By contrast, the conversion of pasture and rainfed agriculture to irrigated agriculture increased SCS100 by 34% (p = 0.034) and 26.5% (p = 0.022), respectively. Spatial changes in historical carbon stocks are strongly associated with land use changes that occurred between 1990 and 2018. We estimated a non-significant loss of 61.9 Tg-C (p = 0.726) from the total carbon stocks (calculated as the sum of AGB, BGB, and SCS) of which 80% of the losses came from soil stocks, 11% from BGB, and 8% from AGB. These findings reveal the need to monitor carbon stocks in sandy soils to reduce the uncertainties of estimates and support the development of effective sustainable agriculture policies. The best alternatives for reducing carbon losses in the Cerrado are to maintain natural forest cover and to recover soils through sustainable soil management, especially in pasturelands where soil carbon stocks are lowest.","[Dionizio, Emily Ane; Pimenta, Fernando Martins; Lima, Lucas Barbosa; Costa, Marcos Heil] Fed Univ Vicosa UFV, Dept Agr Engn, Vicosa, MG, Brazil",,"Pimenta, Fernando Martins/0000-0002-7589-5721; Dionizio da Silva, Emily Ane/0000-0002-1925-1809","PRODEAGRO [011/2016, 045/2019]; Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior-Brasil (CAPES) [001]",PRODEAGRO; Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior-Brasil (CAPES)(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)),This research was funded by PRODEAGRO grants 011/2016 and 045/2019.

This study used remote sensing and environmental-tracer profiles [total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), total organic carbon (TOC), grain size, and geochemical parameters] to determine the causes of changes in land use and the associated environmental parameters. The results of LUCCs (Land use/cover changes) indicate that over the past three decades, total farmland decreased by 862.49 km2, with an annual decrement rate of 28.75 km2/year, and total urbanized land increased by 859.71 km2, with an annual growth rate of 28.66 km2/year. The geochemical results indicate that the trophic state of Taihu Lake was persistently intensifying and that the TN, TP, and TOC concentrations increased twofold, threefold, and twofold, respectively, from 1949 to 2010. The sources of TN, TP, and TOC were highly similar after 1975. However, before 1974, TN and TP originated from different sources than TOC. The grassland and woodland around the lake retain nutrients and sand from the land of study area. The increase in urbanized land and tertiary industries significantly increased the sediment concentrations of TN, TP, and TOC after 1980. ¬© 2015 Huang et al.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2015,10,4,,10.1371/journal.pone.0120319,,,,35214742400;57198825584;55964480200;55367006900;56605870300;55277378900;56605873500;55704405700;,e0120319,,,,17.0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84928473377&doi=10.1371%2fjournal.pone.0120319&partnerID=40&md5=00bbff65e92e57d7f7fea9167a8c42ec,nitrogen; organic carbon; phosphorus; carbon; nitrogen; phosphorus; soil; soil pollutant; agricultural land; Article; China; concentration (parameters); environmental change; environmental parameters; forest; geochemistry; grain; growth rate; lake; land use; nutrient; remote sensing; sand; satellite imagery; sediment; analysis; chemistry; environmental monitoring; eutrophication; human; particle size; remote sensing; soil; soil pollutant; urbanization; Carbon; China; Environmental Monitoring; Eutrophication; Geologic Sediments; Humans; Lakes; Nitrogen; Particle Size; Phosphorus; Remote Sensing Technology; Soil; Soil Pollutants; Urbanization,English,Final,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84928473377,,,,Q2

Finally, the model was constructed by partial least squares regression (PLSR). The results showed that the effects of water treatment on SOC content were different in different growth stages of winter wheat. Results of correlation analysis showed that the differential transformation can refine the spectral characteristics, and improve the correlation between SOC content and spectral reflectance.

Changes in soil carbon storage were lagged behind and thus insignificant over the period, but was expected to follow in the coming decades. As a result, the Loess Plateau ecosystem had shifted from a net carbon source in 2000 to a net carbon sink in 2008.

Scientists and policy analysts increasingly seek to develop programs and policies which recognize the importance of mitigation of climate change and insurance of ecological sustainability when managing agricultural soils. In response, many countries are exploring options to develop local land-use carbon inventories to better understand the flow of carbon in agriculture to estimate its contribution to greenhouse gas (GHG) reporting. For instance, the Canadian province of Ontario does not currently have its own GHG inventory and relies on the Canada‚Äôs National Inventory Report (NIR). To address this, the province explored options to develop its own land-use carbon inventory to better understand the carbon resource in agricultural soils. As part of this undertaking, a gap analysis was conducted to identify the critical information gaps and limitations in estimating soil organic carbon (SOC) monitoring to develop a land-use carbon inventory (LUCI) for the cropland sector in Ontario. We conducted a review of analytical and modeling methods used to quantify GHG emissions and reporting for the cropland sectors in Canada, and compared them with the methods used in seven other countries (i.e., France, United Kingdom; Germany; United States of America, Australia, New Zealand, and Japan). From this comparison, four target areas of research were identified to consider in the development of a cropland sector LUCI in Ontario. First, there needs to be a refinement of the modelling approach used for SOC accounting. The Century model, which is used for Ontario‚Äôs cropland sector, can benefit from updates to the crop growth model and from the inclusion of manure management and other amendments. Secondly, a raster-based spatially explicit modelling approach is recommended as an alternative to using polygon-based inputs for soil data and census information for land management. This approach can leverage readily available Earth Observation (EO) data (e.g., remote sensing maps, digital soil maps). Thirdly, the contributions from soil erosion need to be included in inventory estimates of SOC emissions and removals from cropland. Fourth, establishment of an extensive network of long-term experimental sites to calibrate and validate the SOC models (i.e., CENTURY) is required. This can be done by putting in place a ground-truth program, through farmer-led research initiatives and collaboration, to deal with uncertainties due to spatial variability and regional climates. This approach would provide opportunities for farmers to collaborate on data collection by keeping detailed records of their cropping and soil management practices, and crop yields. ¬© 2021 by the authors.

The goal of this study was to identify the relationship between land cover and carbon flux mediated through precipitation. In order to clarify the general relationship, research was conducted on a range of national scales. Eighty-two watershed samples from an area where the urban land cover area was less than 10% and with a water-quality measurement point at an outlet were delineated. Carbon flux and soil organic carbon of the watershed was estimated using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool model, Forest Biomass and Dead Organic Matter Carbon model, and other data. Finally, the data were analyzed to determine the relationship between soil organic carbon and carbon flux. As a result, it was concluded that the carbon flux of the watershed increased with increasing area of the watershed. Under the same area condition, it was revealed that the greater the forest soil organic carbon, the less the carbon flux released from the watershed. Through this study, it was observed that as the above-ground biomass of forest increased, the carbon flux from watershed to river outlet decreased logarithmically. ",,,,,,,,,,,MDPI,,,,,,,2022,14,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Water,4.0,623,Q2

This study investigated the use of high spatial resolution satellite data (RapidEye and Landsat), terrain/climatic data and laboratory analysed soil samples to map the spatial distribution of six soil properties–sand, silt, clay, cation exchange capacity (CEC), soil organic carbon (SOC) and nitrogen–in a 580 km2 agricultural watershed in south-western Burkina Faso. Four statistical prediction models–multiple linear regression (MLR), random forest regression (RFR), support vector machine (SVM), stochastic gradient boosting (SGB)–were tested and compared. Internal validation was conducted by cross validation while the predictions were validated against an independent set of soil samples considering the modelling area and an extrapolation area. Model performance statistics revealed that the machine learning techniques performed marginally better than the MLR, with the RFR providing in most cases the highest accuracy. The inability of MLR to handle non-linear relationships between dependent and independent variables was found to be a limitation in accurately predicting soil properties at unsampled locations. Satellite data acquired during ploughing or early crop development stages (e.g. May, June) were found to be the most important spectral predictors while elevation, temperature and precipitation came up as prominent terrain/climatic variables in predicting soil properties. The results further showed that shortwave infrared and near infrared channels of Landsat8 as well as soil specific indices of redness, coloration and saturation were prominent predictors in digital soil mapping. Considering the increased availability of freely available Remote Sensing data (e.g. Landsat, SRTM, Sentinels), soil information at local and regional scales in data poor regions such as West Africa can be improved with relatively little financial and human resources.",,,,,,,,,,,"Public Library of Science San Francisco, CA USA",,,,,,,2017,12,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PloS one,1.0,e0170478,Q2

This is primarily because mixing of spectral data from different sources and technologies to improve soil models is still in its infancy. The first objective of this study was to integrate information of SOC derived from visible near-infrared reflectance (Vis-NIR) spectra in the laboratory with remote sensing (RS) images to improve predictions of topsoil SOC in the Skjern river catchment, Denmark. The second objective was to improve SOC prediction results by separately modeling uplands and wetlands. A total of 328 topsoil samples were collected and analyzed for SOC. Satellite Pour l’Observation de la Terre (SPOT5), Landsat Data Continuity Mission (Landsat 8) images, laboratory Vis-NIR and other ancillary environmental data including terrain parameters and soil maps were compiled to predict topsoil SOC using Cubist regression and Bayesian kriging. The results showed that the model developed from RS data, ancillary environmental data and laboratory spectral data yielded a lower root mean square error (RMSE) (2.8%) and higher R2(0.59) than the model developed from only RS data and ancillary environmental data (RMSE: 3.6%, R2: 0.46). Plant-available water (PAW) was the most important predictor for all the models because of its close relationship with soil organic matter content. Moreover, vegetation indices, such as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), were very important predictors in SOC spatial models. Furthermore, the ‘upland model’ was able to more accurately predict SOC compared with the ‘upland & wetland model’. However, the separately calibrated ‘upland and wetland model’ did not improve the prediction accuracy for wetland sites, since it was not possible to adequately discriminate the vegetation in the RS summer images. We conclude that laboratory Vis-NIR spectroscopy adds critical information that significantly improves the prediction accuracy of SOC compared to using RS data alone. We recommend the incorporation of laboratory spectra with RS data and other environmental data to improve soil spatial modeling and digital soil mapping (DSM).",,,,,,,,,,,"Public Library of Science San Francisco, CA USA",,,,,,,2015,10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PloS one,11.0,e0142295,Q2

However, carbon inventories based on field plots alone cannot capture the heterogeneity of carbon stocks, and thus remote sensing-assisted approaches are critically important to carbon mapping at regional to global scales. We advanced a high-resolution, national-scale carbon mapping approach applied to the Republic of Panama – one of the first UN REDD_+_partner countries. Integrating measurements of vegetation structure collected by airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) with field inventory plots, we report LiDAR-estimated aboveground carbon stock errors of ~10% on any 1-ha land parcel across a wide range of ecological conditions. Critically, this shows that LiDAR provides a highly reliable replacement for inventory plots in areas lacking field data, both in humid tropical forests and among drier tropical vegetation types. We then scale up a systematically aligned LiDAR sampling of Panama using satellite data on topography, rainfall, and vegetation cover to model carbon stocks at 1-ha resolution with estimated average pixel-level uncertainty of 20.5 Mg C ha-1 nationwide. The national carbon map revealed strong abiotic and human controls over Panamanian carbon stocks, and the new level of detail with estimated uncertainties for every individual hectare in the country sets Panama at the forefront in high-resolution ecosystem management. With this repeatable approach, carbon resource decision-making can be made on a geospatially explicit basis, enhancing human welfare and environmental protection.",,,,,,,,,,,Springer,,,,,,,2013,8,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Carbon balance and management,1.0,14-Jan,Q2

Mapping of soil degradation by remote sensing is instrumental for understanding the spatial extent and rate of this problem. Methods aimed at detecting soil loss, soil drying, and soil-quality deterioration have been demonstrated in numerous studies utilizing passive and active remote sensors. This review presents a short description of each form of soil degradation, including data regarding known extents and rates, and then reviews the methods with respect to direct and indirect modelling approaches. Two types of obstacles to achieving wide regional detection of soil degradation are revealed. The first concerns the complex and non-unique relationships between remote-sensing indicators and different soil properties, such as roughness, soil moisture (SM), soil salinity, and organic matter content. The second concerns the difficulties involved in acquiring data on subsurface soil properties. In view of these difficulties, we recommend expanding the use of phenomenological models capable of estimating soil-degradation potential according to combinations of environmental conditions, thus enabling remote-sensing efforts to be focused on local areas where the environmental threat is highest. The second avenue for improving the contribution of remote sensing on a wide regional scale involves the application of integrative methods, such as those based on hyperspectral, multisensory, and multitemporal approaches, as well as those that incorporate environmental information (such as topography, soil types, and precipitation).",,,,,,,,,,,Taylor & Francis,,,,,,,2013,34,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,International Journal of Remote Sensing,17.0,6152-6181,Q2

The high annual variability of the phenological cycle considerably affects the agricultural population with late rainfalls and droughts, often resulting in serious food crises. On the other hand, the rapidly growing population has a great need for space due to expanding cities and a low agricultural efficiency. This situation, together with a changing climate, has had a strong impact on vegetation dynamics in West Africa and will play a major role in the future. The dynamic nature of vegetation in the region has attracted a lot of remote-sensing-based research in the past 30 years and has lead to heated discussions. This review article gives a comprehensive overview of the studies on remotely sensed vegetation dynamics in West Africa. After an introduction to the specific situation for vegetation dynamics in West Africa, the applied sensors and their suitability for the region are outlined. Research on the assessment of different plant parameters, on phenological metrics as well as on the monitoring of agricultural areas is outlined and discussed.

To quantify carbon sequestration, we accessed a sample group of trees with measured biophysical attributes. First, we calculated the biomass and carbon sequestration of a tree using the allometric and photosynthesis equations. Then, to model the spatial distribution of carbon sequestration, we used geographic weighted regression (GWR) method. In this model, the amount of calculated carbon sequestration was the dependent variable, whereas the difference between vegetation indexes of Excess Green Plant Index minus Excess Red Plant Index (_ExGR) from the Worldview image was the independent variable. Subsequently, the spatial distribution map of CO2absorption and oxygen production was generated. The total value of annual carbon sequestration, CO2 absorption, and O2 production was about 7704.22, 28274.502, and 20570.16 tons, respectively. The results showed that there was a strong correlation between the _ExGR index of the canopy with calculated carbon. Integrating the _ExGR index from a high-resolution image with calculated carbon can contribute to developing a fast, accurate, and low-cost method in estimating carbon sequestration and modeling its spatial distribution in urban areas. In conclusion, the results of this research can be implemented by land-use planners to integrate urban ecosystem service concept (i.e., carbon sequestration) in planning process toward sustainability of the cities.",,,,,,,,,,,Wiley Online Library,,,,,,,2022,9,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Earth and Space Science,7.0,e2022EA002261,Q2

Knowing what soil parameters have the greatest influence on bare soil imagery will facilitate better use of remote sensing for precision crop management. The objectives of this study were (i) to determine measured soil properties that are most influential on remotely sensed bare soil reflectance and (ii) to select which spectral band or combination of spectral bands is best for describing individual soil properties. This study was conducted on three study sites located in northeastern Colorado. All sites were in irrigated continuous corn (Zea mays L.) cropping systems. Remotely sensed imagery was acquired by aircraft prior to planting. Soil samples were collected and analyzed for bulk density, soil color (moist and dry), organic matter, organic carbon, soil texture, and cone index. Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed for the green, red, and near-infrared (NIR) bands of the imagery. Least-squares regression analysis was used for analyzing relationships between remote sensing data and soil data. Across study sites, the first principal components of the green, red, and NIR bands were found to have significant statistical relationships with organic carbon and sand, silt, and clay fractions. Individual spectral bands explained a significant portion of the variability in soil moisture, moist soil color, dry soil color, organic carbon, sand, silt, and clay. Results from this study support the use of remote sensing for assessment of soil variability.

This would enable estimation of how much carbon emission a project could potentially prevent and thus how much carbon credit should be rewarded. However, different factors like forest degradation and the lack of linearity in forest cover transitions challenge the accuracy of such scenarios. Here we predict and validate such BAU scenarios retrospectively based on forest cover changes at village and district level in North Central Vietnam. With the government's efforts to increase the forest cover, land use policies led to gradual abandonment of shifting cultivation since the 1990s. We analyzed Landsat images from 1973, 1989, 1998, 2000, and 2011 and found that the policies in the areas studied did lead to increased forest cover after a long period of decline, but that this increase could mainly be attributed to an increase in open forest and shrub areas. We compared Landsat classifications with participatory maps of land cover/use in 1998 and 2012 that indicated more forest degradation than was captured by the Landsat analysis. The BAU scenarios were heavily dependent on which years were chosen for the reference period. This suggests that hypothetical REDD+ activities in the past, when based on the remote sensing data available at that time, would have been unable to correctly estimate changes in carbon stocks and thus produce relevant BAU scenarios.","[Ankersen, Jeppe; Grogan, Kenneth; Mertz, Ole; Fensholt, Rasmus; Rasmussen, Kjeld] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Geosci & Nat Resource Management, DK-1350 Copenhagen K, Denmark; [Castella, Jean-Christophe; Lestrelin, Guillaume] IRD, GRED, UMR 220, Viangchan, Lao PDR, Laos; [Nguyen, Dinh Tien] Vietnam Natl Univ Agr, Ctr Agr Res & Ecol Studies, Hanoi, Vietnam; [Danielsen, Finn; Brofeldt, Soren] NORDECO, DK-1159 Copenhagen K, Denmark",,"Brofeldt, S√∏ren/0000-0003-3519-5648; Lestrelin, Guillaume/0000-0001-6207-218X; Rasmussen, Kjeld/0000-0003-3111-584X; Castella, Jean-Christophe/0000-0003-3532-0728; Mertz, Ole/0000-0002-3876-6779; Nguyen, Dinh Tien/0000-0002-2215-0830; Grogan, Kenneth/0000-0003-1257-6245; Fensholt, Rasmus/0000-0003-3067-4527","European Community's Seventh Framework Research Programme; Global Land Project, University of Copenhagen","European Community's Seventh Framework Research Programme; Global Land Project, University of Copenhagen","This research is part of the research project entitled Impacts of Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation and Enhancing Carbon Stocks (I-REDD+).

The aboveground C stock of agroecosystem allocated in foliage (7.8 %), stem (57.6 %), and grain (35.1 %). Survey about the fate of post-harvested materials indicated that aboveground portion of the crop is almost used completely within the year for different purposes including human consumption and cattle feeding. Therefore, only BNP and litter contribute to long-term C sequestration.

Furthermore, soybean and cornfields having more than 10 years of farming presented higher values of P and Mg+2 than the ideal levels necessary for plant development.

Results refereed to a fluctuation in soil characteristics among different districts, as a result of variation and severity of activities. High levels of OC (3.5-5.21%) were recorded in several scattered parts while northern parts showed high levels of TP and TN recording 0.8-1.7mg/g and 1.7-2.4mg/g respectively. A great fluctuation in salinity, Ca, K, and Na levels were detected among the collected soil samples. Southern and eastern borders of the governorate showed high levels of Ca (>17.7mg/g).

Variation of soil characteristics is greatly impacted by irrigation using wastewater particularly from El-Bats and El-Wadi drains.

Predictions were made using the artificial neural networks (ANNs), regression trees (RTs), and spline functions with auxiliary covariates derived from a digital elevation model (DEM), the Landsat 8 imagery, and land use types. Correlation analysis showed that the main predictors for SOC in the topsoil were covariates derived from the imagery; however, for the lower depths, covariates derived from both the DEM and imagery were important. ANNs showed more efficiency than did RTs in predicting SOC. The results showed that 3D distribution of SOC was significantly affected by land use types. SOC stocks of soils under Or and IF were significantly higher than those under DF, RaG, and RaQ. The SOC below 30¬†cm accounted for about 59% of the total soil stock. Results showed that depth functions combined with digital soil mapping techniques provide a promising approach to evaluate 3D SOC distribution under different land uses in semi-arid regions and could be used to assess changes in time to determine appropriate management strategies. ¬© 2017, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2017,189,3,,10.1007/s10661-017-5830-9,,,,57193517286;26535327300;16836434900;57261043300;57193788613;57193797142;,131,,,,14.0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85016642830&doi=10.1007%2fs10661-017-5830-9&partnerID=40&md5=72047c05c6d92c4f7ca863335f09620e,"Arid regions; Forestry; Land use; Mapping; Neural networks; Organic carbon; Soils; Spatial distribution; Correlation analysis; Different land use types; Digital elevation model; Digital soil mappings; Management strategies; Soil carbon storage; Soil organic carbon; Spline functions; Soil surveys; organic carbon; soil organic carbon; unclassified drug; carbon; soil; artificial neural network; digital elevation model; environmental impact assessment; environmental monitoring; land use; organic carbon; semiarid region; soil depth; soil organic matter; spatial analysis; three-dimensional modeling; agricultural worker; Article; artificial neural network; correlation analysis; correlation coefficient; Iran; land use; orchard; prediction; principal component analysis; regression tree; remote sensing; satellite imagery; semiarid climate; soil depth; spatial analysis; agriculture; chemistry; China; environmental monitoring; procedures; regression analysis; soil; theoretical model; validation study; Iran; Agriculture; Carbon; China; Environmental Monitoring; Iran; Models, Theoretical; Neural Networks (Computer); Regression Analysis; Soil",English,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85016642830,,,,Q3

Spectral remote sensing indices that rely on shortwave-infrared (SWIR) or near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths have been developed to quantify spatial patterns in SOC. However, the application of SWIR- and NIR-based indices for quantifying fine-scale patterns of SOC is limited due to the requirement of high-resolution multispectral or hyperspectral imagery. Visible wavelengths are measured by virtually all sensors, often at high resolution; hence, development of a visible wavelength-based index can greatly increase the ability to remotely estimate SOC. Here we develop such an index by assessing the relationship between laboratory-measured SOC and spectral reflectance using 7916 SOC and hyperspectral measurements from the nationwide USDA Rapid Carbon Assessment. Our new SOC index (SOCI) predicts SOC concentrations for the 7916 samples with a RMSE of 1.5%, which is comparable to predictions from the SWIR/NIR ratio (RMSE = 1.3%) and outperforms the predictions of an index based on NIR and red wavelengths (RMSE = 2.8%). We applied the index to a high-resolution satellite image and tested the ability of the image-based SOCI to predict measured SOC concentrations for a plowed field in Iowa. Regression models with and without local calibration data accurately predict measured SOC, with RMSE values of similar to 0.5%. Given the widespread availability of imagery with spectral data in the visible wavelengths, there is potential to use the SOCI to address a range of soil-agronomic problems.","[Thaler, Evan A.; Larsen, Isaac J.; Yu, Qian] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Geosci, 233 Morrill Sci Ctr, Amherst, MA 01003 USA",,"Yu, Qian/0000-0001-6816-3082",NASA [80NSSCK0747],NASA(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)),"The research was funded by NASA grant 80NSSCK0747 (to I.

The objective of this work was to check the predictive capability of SOC and soil pH over different ecoregions. First, we collected a series of satellite images from 2017 and ancillary variables (e.g., climate and terrain) as spectral and environmental indicators, respectively. A total of 201 topsoil samples (0-20 cm) from the Northeastern Black Soil Region of China were also used. Then, the relationships between the two soil properties and indicators were analyzed. The indicators that showed significant correlation with SOC or soil pH were involved in the subsequent models. Finally, the SOC and soil pH prediction models were constructed by using a stepwise regression model. The results showed that the visible and shortwave infrared bands, along with the thermal infrared band, had strong correlations with the two soil properties. Environmental factors such as precipitation, temperature, and elevation all had an impact on the distribution of SOC and soil pH. The SOC and soil pH prediction models had R-2 values of 0.66 and 0.73, root mean square errors of 0.21 and 0.58, and residual prediction deviations of 1.46 and 1.53, respectively, indicating reliable precision and average prediction abilities. This approach to estimating SOC and soil pH can contribute to improving our understanding and the modeling of soil processes at a large scale and in areas with relatively complex landscapes.","[Zhang, Yue; Shen, Haiou; Gao, Qiang; Zhao, Lanpo] Jilin Agr Univ, Coll Resources & Environm, 2888 Xincheng Rd, Changchun 130118, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Yue; Shen, Haiou; Gao, Qiang; Zhao, Lanpo] Jilin Agr Univ, Key Lab Soil Resource Sustainable Utilizat Jilin, 2888 Xincheng Rd, Changchun 130118, Peoples R China",,,National Key R&D Program of China [2016YFE0202900]; Education Department of Jilin Province [JJKH20190915KJ],National Key R&D Program of China; Education Department of Jilin Province,"National Key R&D Program of China, Grant/Award Number: (2016YFE0202900); Education Department of Jilin Province, Grant/Award Number: (JJKH20190915KJ)",,57.0,7.0,7.0,WILEY,0361-5995,1435-0661,,SOIL SCI SOC AM J,Soil Sci.

Field experiments were conducted to estimate the rice leaf area index under elevated carbon dioxide using hyperspectral remote sensing. The results showed that various spectral parameters, including the first derivative reflectance at 467 nm, the yellow edge amplitude, the normalized value of the green peak and red valley reflectance, the ratio of red edge and blue edge area, and the normalized value of the red edge and blue edge area, have a significantly correlated with the leaf area index. Further comparing the results of models, the normalized value of the green peak and red valley reflectance exhibited the optimal performance for estimating leaf area index.

We classified decadal Landsat images as forest, agriculture, urban, and water. We used 812 previously delineated Bays to identify common Bay soils. From areas with common Bay soils and land-use change, we identified 548 new Bays and delineated them using a semi-automated on-line digitization tool.

The objectives of this study were to (i) assess how well C could be predicted across a wide range of soils, (ii) determine how varying soil moisture impacted OC predictions, and (iii) determine the spectral wavelengths useful for assessing OC. Soil samples from the North American Proficiency Testing (NAPT) Program soil library were utilized in this study. Spectral reflectance (800–2200 nm) was measured with a spectrometer for air-dried soil and with 15, 20, and 25% soil moisture. Several pretreatment spectral reflectances were analyzed with partial least square (PLS) regression. The best pretreatment was the first derivative, explaining 88% of OC variability with air-dried samples and 70% at 15% soil moisture. Predictions for the samples of 20% (r2 = 0.64) and 25% (r2 = 0.63) soil moisture were as good as the combined datasets. These datasets included the 15 and 20% (r2 = 0.56), 15 and 25% (r2 = 0.64), 20 and 25% (r2 = 0.59), and 15, 20, and 25% (r2 = 0.64) soil moistures. The variable importance for prediction identified wavelengths associated with organic components including aromatics, aliphatics, and amides. Clustering the latent vectors suggested that PLS was able to distinguish samples with different clay and Fe content despite that they were not included as predictors. This study suggests that spectral OC prediction with varying soil moisture content (i.e., between 15 and 25% moisture) is of acceptable quality (i.e., r2 ≥ 0.56) even across a range of soils from the United States. These findings have important implications for estimating OC with proximal and remote sensing techniques.",,,,,,,,,,,Wiley Online Library,,,,,,,2014,78,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Soil Science Society of America Journal,3.0,958-967,Q3
