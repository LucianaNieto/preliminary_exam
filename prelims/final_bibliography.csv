The aim of this study was to investigate the potential of UAS (Unmanned Aerial Systems) multi-spectral imagery (480–1000 nm) for estimating the SOC content in bare cultivated soils at a high spatial resolution (12 cm). We performed UAS analysis on the Hoosﬁeld Spring Barley experiment at Rothamsted (UK) where adjacent plots with distinctly different SOC contents, due to different long-term management practices, provide a valuable resource to evaluate this approach. We acquired images (wavelength: 480–550–670–780–880–1000 nm) at an altitude of 120 m over an area of 2 ha using a multi-spectral camera mounted on an UAS. The high-resolution images captured smallscale variations at the soil surface (e.g. shadows, tillage and wheels marks). After a projection in new dimensions by a PCA, we calibrated a support vector machine regression using observations from conventional soil sampling and SOC measurements. The performance of the calibration had a R2 of 0.98 and a RMSE of 0.17%C. A crossvalidation showed that the model was robust, with an average R2 of 0.95 and a RMSE of 0.21%. An external validation dataset was used to evaluate the predicted spatial patterns of SOC content and a good ﬁt with an RMSE 0.26%C was obtained. Although this study shows that the methodology has a clear potential for use in precision agriculture or monitoring important soil properties following changes in management, we also identify and discuss its limitations and current shortcomings.",2016-08,9/1/22 17:05,9/1/22 17:05,9/1/22 17:05,55-66,,,275,,Geoderma,UAS-based soil carbon mapping using VIS-NIR (480–1000 nm) multi-spectral imaging,,,,,,,en,,,,,DOI.org (Crossref),,,,/Users/luciananieto/Zotero/storage/T3KFC4MB/Aldana-Jague et al. - 2016 - UAS-based soil carbon mapping using VIS-NIR (480–1.pdf

Correlation analysis showed that the main predictors for SOC in the topsoil were covariates derived from the imagery; however, for the lower depths, covariates derived from both the DEM and imagery were important. ANNs showed more efficiency than did RTs in predicting SOC. The results showed that 3D distribution of SOC was significantly affected by land use types. SOC stocks of soils under Or and IF were significantly higher than those under DF, RaG, and RaQ. The SOC below 30 cm accounted for about 59% of the total soil stock.

Proximal and remote soil sensing are particularly valuable for this purpose, and there is great scope for their synergic use. The objective of this study was to compare different methods allowing the joint exploitation of hyperspectral satellite data and geophysical data for estimating soil properties at the field scale. Soil samples were collected in an agricultural field in Central Italy for the determination of several soil properties. Satellite images were acquired by the CHRIS-PROBA sensor, both under bare soil conditions and when the field was covered by a wheat crop. Geophysical data were obtained by the automatic resistivity profiling method (ARP), providing apparent soil electrical resistivity of the 0 to 50 cm layer. Regression-kriging (RK), partial least square regression (PLSR), and a combination of PLSR with geostatistics through kriging of the PLSR residuals (PLSR-K) were applied to estimate soil properties by employing all combinations of the available covariates. A multiple jack-knifing procedure was used for a statistical comparison of the ratio of performance to deviation (RPD) statistics across 300 replicates. Clay, sand, and available soil water content were estimated with a sufficient degree of accuracy (RPD > 1.4), especially when using the RK technique. PLSR-K estimated these variables with intermediate ability by using only remote sensing covariates and obtained, in most cases, better results than PLSR.

Thus, spatial and temporal monitoring of SOC is extremely important, both from the environmental and economic perspective. In this regard, the high temporal, spatial, and spectral resolution of the Sentinel-2 data can be exploited for monitoring SOC contents in the topsoil of croplands. In this study, we aim to test the eﬀect of the threshold for a spectral index linked to soil moisture and crop residues on the performance of SOC prediction models using the Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI) Sentinel-2 and the European Land Use/cover Area frame Statistical survey (LUCAS) topsoil database. The LUCAS spectral data resampled according to MSI/Sentinel-2 bands, which were used to build SOC prediction models combining pairs of the bands. The SOC models were applied to a Sentinel-2 image acquired in North-Eastern Germany after removing the pixels characterized by clouds and green vegetation. Then, we tested diﬀerent thresholds of the Normalized Burn Ratio 2 (NBR2) index in order to mask moist soil pixels and those with dry vegetation and crop residues. The model accuracy was tested on an independent validation database and the best ratio of performance to deviation (RPD) was obtained using the average between bands B6 and B5 (Red-Edge Carbon Index: RE-CI) (RPD: 4.4) and between B4 and B5 (Red-Red-Edge Carbon Index: RRE-CI) (RPD: 2.9) for a very low NBR2 threshold (0.05). Employing a higher NBR2 tolerance (higher NBR2 values), the mapped area increases to the detriment of the validation accuracy. The proposed approach allowed us to accurately map SOC over a large area exploiting the LUCAS spectral library and, thus, avoid a new ad hoc ﬁeld campaign. Moreover, the threshold for selecting the bare soil pixels can be tuned, according to the goal of the survey. The quality of the SOC map for each tolerance level can be judged based on the ﬁgures of merit of the model.",9/12/19,9/1/22 17:17,9/1/22 17:17,9/1/22 17:17,2121,,18,11,,Remote Sensing,Soil Organic Carbon Mapping Using LUCAS Topsoil Database and Sentinel-2 Data,,,,,,,en,,,,,DOI.org (Crossref),,,,/Users/luciananieto/Zotero/storage/4BUMHHK7/Castaldi et al. - 2019 - Soil Organic Carbon Mapping Using LUCAS Topsoil Da.pdf

Thus, this study aims at comparing the capability of multispectral S2 and airbornee hyperspectral remote sensing data for SOC prediction, and at the same time, we investigated the importance of spectral and spatial resolution through the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the variable importance in the prediction (VIP) models and the spatial variability of the SOC maps at field and regional scales. We tested the capability of the S2 data to predict SOC in croplands with quite different soil types and parent materials in Germany, Luxembourg and Belgium, using multivariate statistics and local ground calibration with soil samples. We split the calibration dataset into sub-regions according to soil maps and built a multivariate regression model within each sub-region. The prediction accuracy obtained by S2 data is generally slightly lower than that retrieved by airbornee hyperspectral data. The ratio of performance to deviation (RPD) is higher than 2 in Luxembourg (2.6) and German (2.2) site, while it is 1.1 in the Belgian area. After the spectral resampling of the airbornee data according to S2 band, the prediction accuracy did not change for four out of five of the sub-regions. The variable importance values obtained by S2 data showed the same trend as the airbornee VIP values, while the importance of SWIR bands decreased using airbornee data resampled according the S2 bands. These differences of VIP values can be explained by the loss of spectral resolution as compared to APEX data and the strong difference in terms of SNR between the SWIR region and other spectral regions.

Four current (EO-1 ALI and Hyperion, Landsat 8 OLI, Sentinel-2 MSI) and three forthcoming (EnMAP, PRISMA and HyspIRI) satellite imagers were compared. To this aim, two soil spectra datasets that simulated each imager were obtained: (i) resampled spectra according to the speciﬁc spectral response and resolution of each satellite imager and (ii) resampled spectra with declared or actual noise (radiometric and atmospheric) added. Compared with those using full spectral resolution data, the accuracy of Partial Least Square Regression (PLSR) predictive models generally decreased when using resampled spectra. In the absence of noise, the performances of hyperspectral imagers, in terms of Ratio of Performance to Interquartile Range (RPIQ), were generally signiﬁcantly better than those of multispectral imagers. For instance the best RPIQ for sand estimation was obtained using EnMAP simulated data (2.56), whereas the outcomes gained using multispectral imagers varied from 1.56 and 2.28. The addition of noise to the simulated spectra brought about a decrease of statistical accuracy in all estimation models, especially for Hyperion data. Although the addition of noise reduced the performance differences between multispectral and hyperspectral imagers, the forthcoming hyperspectral imagers nonetheless provided the best RPIQ values for clay (2.16–2.33), sand (2.10–2.17), silt (2.77–2.85) and organic carbon (2.48–2.51) estimation.

Accurately mapping SOM at regional scales is of critical importance for sustainable agriculture and soil utilization management and remains a grand challenge. Many studies used soil sampling data and machine learning algorithms to predict SOM at regional scales for a given year, while few studies mapped SOM for multiple years and examined its temporal dynamics. We compared the performance of four machine learning algorithms: decision tree (DT), bagging decision tree (BDT), random forest (RF), and gradient boosting regression trees (GBRT) in mapping SOM in Hubei province, China over the 18-year period from 2000 to 2017. Our results showed that RF and DT had the highest coefficient of determination (R2) (0.61) and the lowest potential bias (9.48 g/kg), respectively, while GBRT had the lowest mean error (ME) (1.26 g/kg), root mean squared error (RMSE) (5.41 g/kg) and Lin's concordance correlation coefficient (LCCC) (0.72). The SOM map based on GBRT better captured the distribution of the soil sample data than that based on RF. The trained GBRT model and the spatially explicitly data on explanatory variables (e.g., climate, terrain, remote sensing) were used to predict SOM for each 500 m × 500 m grid cell in Hubei for the period from 2000 to 2017. Our results showed that the SOM content of cropland was relatively high in the southeast and relatively low in the north. The SOM content in the topsoil varied from 0.89 to 58.86 g/kg and was averaged at 20.52 g/kg. The mean cropland SOM content of the province exhibited an increasing trend from 2000 to 2017 with an increase of 0. 26 g/kg and a growth rate of 1.28%. Spatially, the SOM content increased in southern Hubei and decreased in central and northern parts of the province. A large portion of the areas with decreasing SOM content in northern Hubei was reclaimed cropland, while a large part of the high-quality cropland with rising SOM content in the east (~0.45 × 104 ha) was lost due to land use change (e.g., urbanization).",2019-06,9/1/22 17:05,9/1/22 17:05,9/1/22 17:05,844-855,,,669,,Science of The Total Environment,,,,,,,,en,,,,,DOI.org (Crossref),,,,/Users/luciananieto/Zotero/storage/H5A2IMND/Chen et al. - 2019 - Mapping dynamics of soil organic matter in croplan.pdf

Remote sensing (RS) is in a strong position to provide spatially distributed, reproducible, scale-appropriate and resource-efﬁcient measurements of SOC content and ﬂuxes at ﬁeld, landscape and regional scales. This paper provides a critical review of optical RS techniques for such applications.

Such opportunities include the use of ancillary data, scale-speciﬁc methods, improved development of spectral libraries and better integration of RS technologies into empirical and simulation SOC models.

The remote measurement of SIF opens a new perspective to assess actual photosynthesis at larger, ecologically relevant scales and provides an alternative approach to study the terrestrial carbon cycle. Recent studies demonstrated the reliability of measured SIF signals and showed signiﬁcant relationships between SIF and gross primary production (GPP) at ecosystem and global scales. Despite these encouraging results, understanding the complex mechanisms between SIF and GPP remains challenging before SIF can be ﬁnally utilized to constrain estimates of GPP. In this study, we present a comprehensive assessment of the relationship between far-red SIF retrieved at 760 nm (SIF760) and GPP, and its transferability across three structurally and physiologically contrasting ecosystems: perennial grassland, cropland and mixed temperate forest. We use multi-temporal imaging spectroscopy (IS) data acquired with the airbornee Prism EXperiment (APEX) sensor as well as eddy covariance (EC) ﬂux tower data to evaluate the relationship between SIF760 and GPPEC. We use simulations performed with the coupled photosynthesis–ﬂuorescence model SCOPE to prove trends obtained from our observational data and to assess apparent confounding factors such as physiological and structural interferences or temporal scaling effects. Observed relationships between SIF760 and GPPEC were asymptotic and ecosystem-speciﬁc, i.e., perennial grassland (R2 = 0.59, rRMSE = 27.1%), cropland (R2 = 0.88, rRMSE = 3.5%) and mixed temperate forest (R2 = 0.48, rRMSE = 15.88%). We demonstrate that asymptotic leaf level relationships between SIF760 and GPPEC became more linear at canopy level and scaled with temporal aggregation. We conclude that remote sensing of SIF provides a new observational approach to decrease uncertainties in estimating GPP across ecosystems but requires dedicated strategies to compensate for the various confounding factors impacting SIF–GPP relationships.

Although the consequences of soil quality reduction are generally recognized, the spatial extent of soil degradation is difﬁcult to determine, because no universal equation or soil quality prediction model exists that ﬁts all ecoregions. Furthermore, existing soil organic C (SOC) models generate estimates with uncertainties that may exceed 50%. Therefore it is possible that drastic changes in soil quality may be occurring in sites which are not identiﬁable on existing maps. Soil quality can either be directly inferred from SOC concentration, or through the assessment of the soil physical, chemical and biologic properties. Assessing the spatial distribution of SOC over large areas requires the calibration and development of models derived from laboratory or ﬁeld based techniques.

The availability of new generations of remotely sensed datasets and geographical information system (GIS) models (i.e. GEMS, RothC, and CENTURY) provides new opportunities for predicting soil properties and quality at different spatial scales.

The determination of soil attributes to achieve the best decision making on land use planning is crucial. The use of remote sensing (satellite images) can improve understanding of the surface, since it collects a spectral reﬂectance ﬁngerprint related to soil properties. However, methodologies still gather spatially fragmented information on bare soil in a single image; thus, there is still room to improve information as a continuous surface. This work has the purpose of developing a procedure using multi-temporal satellite image information, aiming to construct a single synthetic image which would represent soils. The work was carried out in the state of São Paulo, Brazil, on a site covering 14,614 km2. The procedure, designated as Geospatial Soil Sensing System (GEOS3), is based on the following steps: a) creation of a database with Landsat 5 legacy data.; b) ﬁltering of the database to provide images only from the dry season in the region; c) insertion of a set of rules into the system to ﬁlter other objects besides soils; d) Each bare soil occurrence for each location along the time-series was used to calculate a Temporal Synthetic Spectral Reﬂectance (TESS) of the soil surface; e) aggregation of all TESS composes the Synthetic Soil Image (SYSI); f) quantitative and qualitative validation of the SYSI through the correlation between laboratory and TESS, soil line assessment and the principal component analysis (PCA). GEOS3 was able to provide the best representative reﬂectance of soils for each band during the historical period. Thus, TESS is not the ‘true’ but a synthetic spectral reﬂectance. The canonical correlation between laboratory and satellite data reached 0.93. A value of up to 0.88 in the Pearson's correlation between laboratory and TESS was also achieved. In a single scene, only 0.5% of area was available as isolated bare soil for spatial analysis. However, SYSI reached 68%. Considering only the sugarcane agricultural areas, a value of 92% was achieved. Our study indicates that a multi-temporal data mining procedure can retrieve soil surface representation. The key to the results was calculating the median spectral reﬂectance from the bare soil pixels along the period of the time series. GEOS3 products can aid soil evaluation by assisting in digital soil mapping, soil security, precision agriculture, soil attribute quantiﬁcation, soil conservation, environment monitoring and soil sample allocation, among others.",2018-06,9/1/22 17:15,9/1/22 17:15,9/1/22 17:15,161-175,,,212,,Remote Sensing of Environment,Geospatial Soil Sensing System (GEOS3),,,,,,,en,,,,,DOI.org (Crossref),,,,/Users/luciananieto/Zotero/storage/BBTL5NYA/Demattê et al. - 2018 - Geospatial Soil Sensing System (GEOS3) A powerful.pdf

However, the use of remote sensing for SOC prediction is often hindered by disturbing factors at the soil surface, such as photosynthetic active and nonphotosynthetic active vegetation, variation in soil moisture or surface roughness. With the increasing amount of freely available satellite data, recent studies have focused on stabilizing the soil reﬂectance by building image composites. These composites tend to minimize the disturbing effects by applying sets of criteria. Here, we aim to develop a robust method that allows selecting Sentinel-2 (S-2) pixels with minimal inﬂuence of the following disturbing factors: crop residues, surface roughness and soil moisture. We selected all S-2 cloud-free images covering the Belgian Loam Belt from January 2019 to December 2020 (in total 36 images). We then built nine exposed soil composites based on four sets of criteria: (1) lowest Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR2), (2) Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) < 0.25, (3–5) NDVI < 0.25 and NBR2 < threshold, (6) the ‘greening-up’ period of a crop and (7–9) the ‘greening-up’ period of a crop and NBR2 < threshold. The ‘greening-up’ period was selected based on the NDVI timeline, where ‘greening-up’ is considered as the last date of acquisition where the soil is exposed (NDVI < 0.25) before the crop develops (NDVI > 0.25). We then built a partial least square regression (PLSR) model with 10-fold cross-validation to estimate the SOC content based on 137 georeferenced calibration samples on the nine composites. We obtained non-satisfactory results (R2 < 0.30, RMSE > 2.50 g C kg–1, and RPD < 1.4, n > 68) for all composites except for the composite in the ‘greening-up’ stage with a NBR2 < 0.07 (R2 = 0.54 ± 0.12, RPD = 1.68 ± 0.45 and RMSE = 2.09 ± 0.39 g C kg–1, n = 49). Hence, the ‘greening-up’ method combined with a strict NBR2 threshold allows selecting the purest exposed soil pixels suitable for SOC prediction. The limit of this method might be its coverage of the total cropland area, which in a two-year period reached 62%, compared to 95% coverage if only the NDVI threshold is applied.",5/4/21,9/1/22 17:05,9/1/22 17:05,9/1/22 17:05,1791,,9,13,,Remote Sensing,,,,,,,,en,,,,,DOI.org (Crossref),,,,/Users/luciananieto/Zotero/storage/JTPXQSYD/Dvorakova et al. - 2021 - Sentinel-2 Exposed Soil Composite for Soil Organic.pdf

Hence, there is a strong demand for mapping and monitoring critical soil properties and in particular soil organic carbon (SOC). Pilot studies have demonstrated the potential for remote sensing techniques for SOC mapping in croplands. It has, however, been shown that the assessment of SOC may be hampered by the condition of the soil surface. While growing vegetation can be readily detected by means of the well-known Normalized Di↵erence Vegetation Index (NDVI), the distinction between bare soil and crop residues is expressed in the shortwave infrared region (SWIR), which is only covered by two broad bands in Landsat or Sentinel-2 imagery. Here we tested the e↵ect of thresholds for the Cellulose Absorption Index (CAI), on the performance of SOC prediction models for cropland soils. airbornee Prism Experiment (APEX) hyperspectral images covering an area of 240 km2 in the Belgian Loam Belt were used together with a local soil dataset. We used the partial least square regression (PLSR) model to estimate the SOC content based on 104 georeferenced calibration samples (NDVI < 0.26), ﬁrstly without setting a CAI threshold, and obtained a satisfactory result (coe cient of determination (R2) = 0.49, Ratio of Performance to Deviation (RPD) = 1.4 and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) = 2.13 g kgC 1 for cross-validation). However, a cross comparison of the estimated SOC values to grid-based measurements of SOC content within three ﬁelds revealed a systematic overestimation for ﬁelds with high residue cover. We then tested di↵erent CAI thresholds in order to mask pixels with high residue cover. The best model was obtained for a CAI threshold of 0.75 (R2 = 0.59, RPD = 1.5 and RMSE = 1.75 g kgC 1 for cross-validation). These results reveal that the purity of the pixels needs to be assessed aforehand in order to produce reliable SOC maps. The Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR2) index based on the SWIR bands of the MSI Sentinel 2 sensor extracted from images collected nine days before the APEX ﬂight campaign correlates well with the CAI index of the APEX imagery. However, the NBR2 index calculated from Sentinel 2 images under moist conditions is poorly correlated with residue cover. This can be explained by the sensitivity of the NBR2 index to both soil moisture and residues.",6/12/20,9/1/22 17:05,9/1/22 17:05,9/1/22 17:05,1913,,12,12,,Remote Sensing,Soil Organic Carbon Mapping from Remote Sensing,,,,,,,en,,,,,DOI.org (Crossref),,,,/Users/luciananieto/Zotero/storage/YUIMP6E8/Dvorakova et al. - 2020 - Soil Organic Carbon Mapping from Remote Sensing T.pdf

Over the past several decades, net loss of CO2  from the atmosphere to the land and oceans has varied considerably from year to year, equaling 20 to 80% of CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion and land use change. On average, the uptake is about 50%. The imbalance between CO2 emissions and removal is seen in increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations. In recent years, an increase of 2 to 3 parts per million (ppm) per year in the atmospheric mole fraction, which is currently about 400 ppm, has been observed. Almost a quarter of the CO2 emitted by human activities is being absorbed by the ocean, and another quarter is absorbed by processes on land. The identity and location of the terrestrial sinks are poorly understood. This absorption has been attributed by some to tropical or Eurasian temperate forests, whereas others argue that these regions may be net sources of CO2 . The efficiency of these land sinks appears to vary dramatically from year to year. Because the identity, location, and processes controlling these natural sinks are not well constrained, substantial additional uncertainty is added to projections of future CO2 levels. The NASA satellite, the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2), which was launched on 2 July 2014, is designed to collect global measurements with sufficient precision, coverage, and resolution to aid in resolving sources and sinks of  CO2 on regional scales. Since 6 September 2014, the OCO-2 mission has been producing about 2 million estimates of the column-averaged  CO2 dry-air mole fraction (XCO2) each month after quality screening, with spatial resolution of <3 km2per sounding. Solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF), a small amount of light emitted during photosynthesis, is detected in remote sensing measurements of radiance within solar Fraunhofer lines and is another data product from OCO-2. The measurements from OCO-2 provide a global view of the seasonal cycles and spatial patterns of atmospheric CO2, with the anticipated year-over-year growth rate. The buildup of  CO2 in the Northern Hemisphere during winter and its rapid decrease in concentration as spring arrives (and the SIF increases) is seen in unprecedented detail. The enhanced  CO2 in urban areas relative to nearby background areas is observed with a single overpass of OCO-2. Increases in  CO2 due to the biomass burning in Africa are also clearly observed. The dense, global,XCO2 and SIF data sets from OCO-2 are combined with other remote sensing data sets and used to disentangle the processes driving the carbon cycle on regional scales during the recent 2015–2016 El Niño event. This analysis shows more carbon release in 2015 relative to 2011 over Africa, South America, and Southeast Asia. Now, the fundamental driver for the change in carbon release can be assessed continent by continent, rather than treating the tropics as a single, integrated region. Small changes in X CO2 were also observed early in the El Niño over the equatorial eastern Pacific, due to less upwelling of cold, carbon-rich water than is typical. NASA’s OCO-2 mission is collecting a dense, global set of high-spectral resolution measurements that are used to estimate XCO2 and SIF. The OCO-2 mission data set can now be used to assess regional-scale sources and sinks of  CO2 around the globe. The papers in this collection present early scientific findings from this new data set. El Niño impact on carbon flux in 2015 relative to 2011, detected from Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite (GOSAT) and OCO-2 data. OCO-2 uses reflected sunlight to derive XCO2 and SIF. This shows OCO-2 xCO2 data over North America from 12 August 2015 to 26 August 2015. NASA’s Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) mission was motivated by the need to diagnose how the increasing concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO 2) is altering the productivity of the biosphere and the uptake of CO2 by the oceans. Launched on 2 July 2014, OCO-2 provides retrievals of the column-averaged CO2 dry-air mole fraction (X CO2) as well as the fluorescence from chlorophyll in terrestrial plants. The seasonal pattern of uptake by the terrestrial biosphere is recorded in fluorescence and the drawdown of XCO2during summer. Launched just before one of the most intense El Niños of the past century, OCO-2 measurements of XCO2and fluorescence record the impact of the large change in ocean temperature and rainfall on uptake and release of CO2by the oceans and biosphere.",10/13/17,9/1/22 17:17,9/1/22 17:17,9/1/22 17:17,eaam5745,,6360,358,,Science,,,,,,,,en,,,,,DOI.org (Crossref),,,,/Users/luciananieto/Zotero/storage/SKIK8N9R/Eldering et al. - 2017 - The Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 early science in.pdf

Optical satellite remote sensing oﬀers the potential for frequent surveys over large areas. In addition, the recently-operated Sentinel-2 missions provide free imagery. This study compared the capabilities of Sentinel2 for monitoring and mapping of SOC and soil texture (clay, silt and sand content) with those obtained from airbornee hyperspectral (CASI/SASI sensors) and lab ASD FieldSpec spectroradiometer measurements at four agricultural sites in the Czech Republic. Combination of 10 extracted bands of the Sentinel-2 and 18 spectral indices, as independent variables, were used to train prediction models and then produce spatial distribution maps of the selected attributes. Results showed that the prediction accuracy based on lab spectroscopy, airbornee and Sentinel-2 in the majority of the sites was adequate for SOC and fair for clay; however, Sentinel-2 imagery could not be used to detect and map variations in silt and sand. The SOC and clay maps derived from the airbornee and spacebornee datasets showed similar trend, with both performing better where SOC levels were relatively high, though at the highest levels Sentinel-2 was able to create the SOC map more precisely than the airbornee sensors. Taken across all SOC levels measured in the reference data, Sentinel-2 results were marginally lower than lab spectroscopy and airbornee imagery, but this reduction in precision may be oﬀset by the extensive geographical coverage and more frequent revisit characteristic of satellite observation.

The study area was located in southeast Madagascar, in a region that exhibits very high rate of deforestation and which is characterized by both humid and dry climates. We estimated SOC stock on 0.1 ha plots for 95 different locations in a 43,000 ha reference area covering both dry and humid conditions and representing different land cover including natural forest, cropland, pasture and fallows.

However, current global model predictions of crop photosynthesis are highly uncertain. Here we demonstrate that new space-based observations of chlorophyll fluorescence, an emission intrinsically linked to plant biochemistry, enable an accurate, global, and time-resolved measurement of crop photosynthesis, which is not possible from any other remote vegetation measurement. Our results show that chlorophyll fluorescence data can be used as a unique benchmark to improve our global models, thus providing more reliable projections of agricultural productivity and climate impact on crop yields. The enormous increase of the observational capabilities for fluorescence in the very near future strengthens the relevance of this study.           ,              Photosynthesis is the process by which plants harvest sunlight to produce sugars from carbon dioxide and water. It is the primary source of energy for all life on Earth; hence it is important to understand how this process responds to climate change and human impact. However, model-based estimates of gross primary production (GPP, output from photosynthesis) are highly uncertain, in particular over heavily managed agricultural areas. Recent advances in spectroscopy enable the space-based monitoring of sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) from terrestrial plants. Here we demonstrate that spacebornee SIF retrievals provide a direct measure of the GPP of cropland and grassland ecosystems. Such a strong link with crop photosynthesis is not evident for traditional remotely sensed vegetation indices, nor for more complex carbon cycle models. We use SIF observations to provide a global perspective on agricultural productivity. Our SIF-based crop GPP estimates are 50–75% higher than results from state-of-the-art carbon cycle models over, for example, the US Corn Belt and the Indo-Gangetic Plain, implying that current models severely underestimate the role of management. Our results indicate that SIF data can help us improve our global models for more accurate projections of agricultural productivity and climate impact on crop yields.

At regional and global scales, digital mapping of SOC has been successful using environmental variables such as climatic, land use and terrain factors. However, such a mapping for agricultural lands in low-relief areas cannot be resolved due to weak spatial variations of the environmental variables. An alternative approach, based on time series of remote sensing images, has recently been emphasized in estimating SOC since crop growth status clearly revealed by satellite images is strongly related to SOC. However, there is still a lack of full understanding of impacts of factors such as data source, regression techniques, and spatial resolution on the accuracy of SOC mapping using time series of satellite images.

However, the dynamic monitoring and estimation of SOC are very diﬃcult due to the complex traditional methods and the changing environmental variables. For instance, the calculation of SOC stock requires measurement of a few relevant soil attributes, such as soil organic matter (SOM), soil bulk density (SBD), soil moisture, and soil weight, in the laboratory. Many studies have suggested that visible and near-infrared (vis–NIR) spectra are a practical and aﬀordable alternative to accurately and rapidly estimate the soil attributes relevant to SOC stock, and airbornee hyperspectral images can be used as a valuable data source to perform digital soil mapping with high spatial resolution. The objective of this research was to check the predicted capability of SOC stock through laboratory and airbornee vis–NIR spectral data. A total of 50 topsoil samples (0–15 cm) from the farmland of Iowa City were used as the study object. The partial least squares regression model was used to predict SOC stock through the direct and indirect methods. In the direct method, the SOC stock was predicted using the spectral data. In the indirect method, the relevant soil properties (SOM and SBD) of the SOC stock were predicted using the spectral data, and then the SOC stock was calculated. The mechanism of the prediction methods and the potential inﬂuencing factors of the model performance were discussed from the aspect of electromagnetic theory and empirical statistics. Results showed the following: (i) SOC stock can be successfully predicted using the laboratory spectra and the airbornee hyperspectral image through the direct and indirect methods; (ii) the SOC stock and its relevant soil properties (SOM and SBD) showed evident spectral absorption characteristics in the vis–NIR spectral band; (iii) the atmospheric environment and soil surface conditions were the main inﬂuencing factors of the prediction accuracy between the airbornee and laboratory spectra.

However, the application of current vegetation productivity algorithms derived from global satellite observations is generally too coarse to capture cropland heterogeneity. The fusion of data from different sensors can provide enhanced information and overcome many of the limitations of individual sensors. In thitables study, we estimate annual crop yields for seven important crop types across Montana in the continental USA from 2008–2015, including alfalfa, barley, maize, peas, durum wheat, spring wheat and winter wheat. We used a satellite data-driven light use efﬁciency (LUE) model to estimate gross primary productivity (GPP) over croplands at 30-m spatial resolution and eight-day time steps using a fused NDVI dataset constructed by blending Landsat (5 or 7) and Terra MODIS reﬂectance data. The fused 30-m NDVI record showed good consistency with the original Landsat and MODIS data, but provides better spatiotemporal delineations of cropland vegetation growth. Crop yields were estimated at 30-m resolution as the product of estimated GPP accumulated over the growing season and a crop-speciﬁc harvest index (HIGPP). The resulting GPP estimates capture characteristic cropland productivity patterns and seasonal variations, while the estimated annual crop production results correspond favorably with reported county-level crop production data (r = 0.96, relative RMSE = 37.0%, p < 0.05) from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). The performance of estimated crop yields at a ﬁner (ﬁeld) scale was generally lower, but still meaningful (r = 0.42, relative RMSE = 50.8%, p < 0.05).

This study aimed to explore the potential of airbornee hyperspectral image to estimate the SOC of bare topsoil at an agricultural site located in the southeast part of Iowa State, United States. To magnify the subtle spectral signals concerning SOC, and accelerate calibration and improve predictive ability, we developed a framework to combine two advanced spectral algorithms, namely, fractional-order derivative (FOD) and optimal band combination algorithm for SOC predicting. Our case was based on 49 soil samples and a scattered airbornee hyperspectral image. Random forest (RF) was utilized to establish SOC estimation models by incorporating the optimal spectral indices processed by different FOD transformations on the basis of the optimal band combination algorithm. Results indicated that when the fractional order increased, overlapping peaks and baseline drifts were gradually removed. However, the magnitude of spectral strength decreased concurrently. More detailed and abundant spectral variability was captured by FOD as compared with those by original reflectance and first and second derivatives. The estimation accuracies developed from the optimal band combination algorithm (crossvalidation R2, 0.36–0.66) were generally better than those from full-spectrum data (cross-validation R2, 0.32–0.54). The RF model based on the combination of 0.75-order reflectance and optimal band combination algorithm obtained the highest estimation accuracy for SOC with cross-validation R2 of 0.66.

Data from Landsat 8 OLI were used to assess the correlation between spectral reﬂectance and diﬀerent vegetation indices on one side, and aboveground biomass (AGB) derived from ground measurements on the other. AGB and CS (ton ha−1) were estimated using traditional destructive methods of standard sampling techniques and allometric equations developed in a previous study for date palms in the area. The relationships between the estimated AGB and parameters derived from remote sensing (RS) data were tested using single and multiple linear regression analysis. The results indicated a signiﬁcant correlation with certain RS parameters. For mature palms class alone (>10 years), the correlation with single bands was only signiﬁcant with SWIR1 and SWIR2 while the correlation was signiﬁcant with all tested VI’s except for TCB vegetation index. A combination of bands R, SWIR1, and SWIR2 improved the determination of this class to a coeﬃcient of determination (R2) value of 0.961. However, for the medium and young age classes (10–5 and less than 5 years), the correlation was not signiﬁcant (with the exception of SWIR1 and TCB index for medium class), where the use of higher spatial resolution can be a good alternative. On the other hand, for mixed ages (young, medium and mature palms), the strongest correlations were found using SWIR2 single band and the SR vegetation index; having R2 values of 0.753 and 0.871, respectively. The R2 was improved to 0.952 by using stepwise multiple regression combining DVI, NDI, and RVI vegetation indices. Finally, results obtained showed that CS represented 53.87% of the total AGB in date palms.

This research aimed at evaluating ML algorithms to predict spatial distribution of soil biological properties and wheat yield in the Southwest of Iran. Topsoil samples (0–30 cm) were collected from a total of 60 sampling locations and wheat grain yield (plot 1 × 1 m) was recorded at each location. Soil properties including urease (Ur), alkaline phosphatase (AP), basal respiration (BR), microbial biomass carbon (MBC), soil organic carbon (SOC), MBC:SOC ratio, and metabolic quotient (qCO2) were measured. At the first step, Random Forest (RF) model was employed to predict soil biological properties by using terrain attributes, remote sensing indices and soil properties as covariates. In this step, both Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) and Pearson regression were applied to select the most important covariates in predicting soil biological properties and to decrease the dimension of the input space with considering no reduction in prediction accuracy. Secondly, wheat grain yield was modeled using six ML algorithms; they were optimized and evaluated in Caret package with 10-fold cross validation. Results showed the highest prediction accuracy for qCO2 (R2adj = 0.80) and the lowest for BR (R2adj = 0.23). Compared to environmental predictors, soil covariates had a greater effect in modeling Ur, qCO2, MBC and MBC:SOC ratio, while, for AP and BR, bands 6 and Chanel Network Base Level were the most important factors, respectively. In prediction of wheat grain yield, both Stochastic Gradient Boosting (SGB) and RF models outperformed with R2adj of 0.89 and 0.88, respectively.

Precise digital soil maps can help to till agricultural ﬁelds with more accuracy, greater cost-efﬁciency and better environmental protection. In the present study, the laboratory analysis of sand, silt, clay and soil organic carbon (SOC) content was combined with hyperspectral image data to estimate the distribution of soil texture and SOC across an agricultural area. The aim was to identify regions with similar soil properties and derive uniform soil regions based on this information. Soil parameter data and corresponding laboratory spectra were used to calibrate cross-validated (leave-one-out) partial least squares regression (PLSR) models, resulting in robust models for sand (R2 = 0.77, root-mean-square error (RMSE) = 5.37) and SOC (R2 = 0.89, RMSE = 0.27), as well as moderate models for silt (R2 = 0.62, RMSE = 5.46) and clay (R2 = 0.53, RMSE = 2.39). The regression models were applied to airbornee Imaging Spectrometer for Applications DUAL (aisaDUAL) hyperspectral image data to spatially estimate the concentration of these parameters. Afterwards, a decision tree, based on the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) soil texture classiﬁcation scheme, was developed to determine the soil texture for each pixel of the hyperspectral airbornee data. These soil texture regions were further reﬁned with the spatial SOC estimations. The developed method is useful to identify spatial regions with similar soil properties, which can provide a vital information source for an adapted treatment of agricultural ﬁelds in terms of the necessary amount of fertilizers or water. The approach can also be adapted to wider regions with a larger sample size to create detailed digital soil maps (DSMs).

Therefore, the spectral dimension needs to be reduced through a selection of speciﬁc spectral bands or regions that are most helpful to describing SOC. This study evaluates the e ciency of visible near-infrared (VNIR) and shortwave near-infrared (SWIR) hyperspectral data to identify the most informative hyperspectral bands responding to SOC content in agricultural soils. Soil samples (111) were collected over an agricultural ﬁeld in southern Ontario, Canada and analyzed against two hyperspectral datasets: An airbornee Nano-Hyperspec imaging sensor with 270 bands (400–1000 nm) and a laboratory hyperspectral dataset (ASD FieldSpec 3) along the 1000–2500 nm range (NIR-SWIR). In parallel, a multimethod modeling approach consisting of random forest, support vector machine, and partial least squares regression models was used to conduct band selections and to assess the validity of the selected bands. The multimethod model resulted in a selection of optimal band or regions over the VNIR and SWIR sensitive to SOC and potentially for mapping.

The “4 per 1000” (4p1000) initiative, launched during the COP 21 in Paris in 2015, based on translating the science of soil carbon sequestration into action at the global scale, is one example of a broader set of negative emission technologies (NETs). While governments and non-governmental organizations are voluntarily implementing the aspirational 4p1000, its adoption and pledges by industry or the private sector is the driving force to accelerate the process of re-carbonization of soil and the terrestrial biosphere. The pledge of achieving carbon (C) neutrality by 2030 or 2050 by some prominent industries is encouraging, and it can serve as a role model for other industries to follow. Adoption of the 4p1000 concept by agro-industries (e.g., fertilizers, pesticides, farm machinery, irrigation, food processing) can promote and accelerate adoption of recommended management practices which create a positive/soil ecosystem carbon budget and enhance C sequestration. This review article describes examples of the emission-neutral concept already adopted by some industries, outlines strategies to promote 4p1000 and NETs, and discusses approaches to advance site-speciﬁc NETs. These techniques may include conservation agriculture, cover cropping, precision agriculture, etc., facilitated by artiﬁcial intelligence, remote sensing, and robots. Innovative methods of soil sampling as well as remote sensing and mapping of SOC stock are pertinent to promoting NETs and 4p1000. Payments to land managers and farmers for provisioning of ecosystem services through C sequestration in soil and the biosphere can advance the mission of 4p1000. Amongst strategies of encouraging industries to adopt NETs, implementation of a “Healthy Soil Act” at the state, national, and global level could be a step in the right direction. Market-based economic incentives to industry may be another option to promote adoption of NETs. Similar to U.S. EPA Clean Air Act of 1963 and the U.S. EPA Clean Water Act of 1972, there is a strong need to enact a Healthy Soil Act globally.

Annual GPP based on GLASS and MCD15 increased over larger fractions of China's vegetated area (15.9% and 17.3%, respectively) than that based on FSGOM (12.6%).

Measurements of carbon fluxes from agricultural fields using micrometeorological techniques such as eddy covariance can improve our understanding of man­ agement and weather-driven changes in carbon budgets. In-situ carbon flux data are also valuable in developing remote sensing-based models for extrapolation of biome-specific carbon budgets to higher spatial scales. In this study, net ecosystem carbon dioxide exchange (NEE) was continuously measured for two years (2017 and 2018) from a cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) field in College Station, Texas, USA. The measured NEE was partitioned into assimilatory (Gross Primary Production, GPP) and respiratory (Ecosystem respiration, Reco) fluxes. There were substantial differences in carbon fluxes between the two years, which were driven by variations in meteor­ ological conditions and growth of weeds. Due to dry conditions, growing season carbon uptake in 2018 was reduced (883 g C m−2) compared to 2017 (947 g C m−2). While the growing season of 2018 was dry, the postharvest off-season was remarkably wet with nearly 68% of the annual precipitation occurring after harvest (848 mm). This favored aggressive growth of weeds, resulting in substantial off-season carbon uptake in 2018 (374 g C m−2 in 2018 compared to 100 g C m−2 in 2017). Overall, the site was a net carbon source (175 g C m−2) in 2017, whereas it was a slight carbon sink (-5 g C m−2) in 2018. A significant correlation was found between satellite-derived normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and GPP (R2 0.78 in 2017 and 0.72 in 2018).

However, large datasets needed to accurately assess SOC at high resolution across scales are labor-intensive, time-consuming, and expensive. Ancillary geodata, including remote sensing spectral indices (RS-SIs) and topographic indicators (TIs), have been proposed as spatial covariates. Reported relationships between SOC and RS-SIs are erratic, possibly because single-date RS-SIs do not accurately capture SOC spatial variability due to transient confounding factors in the soil (e.g., moisture). However, multitemporal RS-SI data analysis may lead to noise reduction in SOC versus RS-SI relationships. This study aimed at: i) comparing single-date versus multitemporal RS-Sis derived from Sentinel-2 imagery for assessment of topsoil (0–0.2 m) SOC in two agricultural ﬁelds located in south-eastern Brazil; ii) comparing the performance of RS-SIs and TIs; iii) using adequate RS-SIs and TIs to compare sampling schemes deﬁned on different collection grids; and iv) studying the temporal changes of SOC (0–0.2 m and 0.2–0.4 m). Results showed that: i) single-date RS-SIs were not reliable proxies for topsoil SOC at the study sites. For most of the tested RS-SIs, multitemporal data analysis produced accurate proxies for SOC; e.g., for the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, the 4.5th multitemporal percentile predicted SOC with an R2 of 0.64; ii) The best TI was elevation (ranging from 643 to 684 m) with an R2 of 0.70; iii) The multitemporal SI and elevation maps indicated that the different sampling schemes were equally representative of the topsoil SOC's distribution across the entire area; and iv) From 2012 through 2019, topsoil SOC increased from 19.3 to 24.1 g kg−1.

This work explores the use of Sentinel-1 (S1) C-band dual polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (SAR), Sentinel-2 (S2) multispectral data, and an innovative machine learning (ML) approach using an integration of active learning for land-use mapping and advanced Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) for robustness of the SOC estimates.

This study evaluated LULC and SOC dynamics using archived and recent soil samples, remote sensing, and digital soil mapping in the Lower Fraser Valley of British Columbia, Canada. We combined both pixel- and object-based analysis of Landsat satellite imagery to assess LULC changes from 1984 to 2018. We achieved an overall accuracy of 81% and kappa coefficient of 0.77 for LULC classification using a random forest model.

This study employed neural networks (NN), multiple linear regressions (MLR), and vegetation indices (VI) to develop algorithms for GPP estimation based solely on remotely sensed data in two crops, maize (Zea mays L.) and soybean [Glycine max (L.)

This is primarily because mixing of spectral data from different sources and technologies to improve soil models is still in its infancy. The first objective of this study was to integrate information of SOC derived from visible near-infrared reflectance (Vis-NIR) spectra in the laboratory with remote sensing (RS) images to improve predictions of topsoil SOC in the Skjern river catchment, Denmark. The second objective was to improve SOC prediction results by separately modeling uplands and wetlands. A total of 328 topsoil samples were collected and analyzed for SOC. Satellite Pour l’Observation de la Terre (SPOT5), Landsat Data Continuity Mission (Landsat 8) images, laboratory Vis-NIR and other ancillary environmental data including terrain parameters and soil maps were compiled to predict topsoil SOC using Cubist regression and Bayesian kriging. The results showed that the model developed from RS data, ancillary environmental data and laboratory spectral data yielded a lower root mean square error (RMSE) (2.8%) and higher R2 (0.59) than the model developed from only RS data and ancillary environmental data (RMSE: 3.6%, R2: 0.46). Plant-available water (PAW) was the most important predictor for all the models because of its close relationship with soil organic matter content. Moreover, vegetation indices, such as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), were very important predictors in SOC spatial models. Furthermore, the ‘upland model’ was able to more accurately predict SOC compared with the ‘upland & wetland model’. However, the separately calibrated ‘upland and wetland model’ did not improve the prediction accuracy for wetland sites, since it was not possible to adequately discriminate the vegetation in the RS summer images. We conclude that laboratory Vis-NIR spectroscopy adds critical information that significantly improves the prediction accuracy of SOC compared to using RS data alone. We recommend the incorporation of laboratory spectra with RS data and other environmental data to improve soil spatial modeling and digital soil mapping (DSM).",11/10/15,9/1/22 17:06,9/1/22 17:06,9/1/22 17:06,e0142295,,11,10,,PLoS ONE,,,,,,,,en,,,,,DOI.org (Crossref),,,,/Users/luciananieto/Zotero/storage/KL6XHCR7/Peng et al. - 2015 - Modeling Soil Organic Carbon at Regional Scale by .pdf

There are many estimation strategies with the potential for more reliable estimates of SOC stock and more efficient use of soil sampling and analysis resources, especially by leveraging readily available auxiliary information such as remote sensing. However, concrete guidance for strategy selection is lacking. This study narrows this gap with a comparison of strategies for estimating deep SOC stock (0–60 cm) in a prototypical field. Using high density SOC stock measurements and simulation, we built on past studies by 1) ex-ante evaluating a large number of strategy options, 2) using a Bayesian approach to quantify the uncertainty of the comparison, and 3) considering multiple Bayesian models to assess sensitivity to this modeling choice. We found that, using readily available auxiliary information, both balanced and stratified sampling offer substantial improvements over simple random sampling. The auxiliary information most important for this improvement is a Sentinel-2 SOC index = blue / (green × red), followed by the topographic wetness index. We found that these results are robust to the choice of mapping method, but that there is uncertainty in the magnitude of improvement.

However, EC measurements represent an integrated flux over their footprint area, which usually differs from respective model grids or remote sensing pixels. Quantifying the uncertainties of scale mismatch associated with gridded flux estimates by upscaling single EC tower NEP measurements to the grid scale is an important but not yet fully investigated issue due to limited data availability as well as knowledge of flux variability at the grid scale. The Heihe Watershed Allied Telemetry Experimental Research (HiWATER) Multi-Scale Observation Experiment on Evapotranspiration (MUSOEXE) built a flux observation matrix that includes 17 EC towers within a 5 km × 5 km area in a heterogeneous agricultural landscape in northwestern China, providing an unprecedented opportunity to evaluate the uncertainty of upscaling due to spatial representative differences at the grid scale. Based on the HiWATER-MUSOEXE data, this study evaluated the spatial representativeness and uncertainty of EC CO2 flux measurements for upscaling to the grid scale using a scheme that combines a footprint model and a model-data fusion method. The results revealed the large spatial variability of gross primary productivity (GPP), ecosystem respiration (Re), and NEP within the study site during the growing season from 10 June to 14 September 2012. The variability of fluxes led to high variability in the representativeness of single EC towers for grid-scale NEP. The systematic underestimations of a single EC tower may reach 92(±11)%, 30(±11)%, and 165(±150)% and the overestimations may reach 25(±14)%, 20(±13)%, and 40(±33)% for GPP, Re, and NEP, respectively. This finding suggests that remotely sensed NEP at the global scale (e.g., MODIS products) should not be validated against single EC tower data in the case of heterogeneous surfaces. Any systematic bias should be addressed before upscaling EC data to grid scale. Otherwise, most of the systematic bias may be propagated to grid scale due to the scale dependence of model parameters. A systematic bias greater than 20% of the EC measurements can be corrected effectively using four indicators proposed in this study. These results will contribute to the understanding of spatial representativeness of EC towers within a heterogeneous landscape, to upscaling carbon fluxes from the footprint to the grid scale, to the selection of the location of EC towers, and to the reduction in the bias of NEP products by using an improved parameterization scheme of remote-sensing driven models, such as VPRM.",2016-12,9/1/22 17:06,9/1/22 17:06,9/1/22 17:06,114-127,,,230-231,,Agricultural and Forest Meteorology,,,,,,,,en,,,,,DOI.org (Crossref),,,,/Users/luciananieto/Zotero/storage/LAIQ4HVE/Ran et al. - 2016 - Spatial representativeness and uncertainty of eddy.pdf

However, quantifying and understanding the cropland C cycle are complex, due to variable environmental drivers, varied management practices and often highly heterogeneous landscapes. Efforts to upscale processes using simulation models must resolve these challenges. In this study we show how data assimilation (DA) approaches can link C cycle modelling to Earth observation (EO) and reduce uncertainty in upscaling. We evaluate a framework for the assimilation of leaf area index (LAI) time-series, derived from EO optical and radar sensors, for state-updating a model of crop development and C ﬂuxes. Sensors are selected with ﬁne spatial resolutions (20–50 m) to resolve variability across ﬁeld sizes typically used in European agriculture (1.5–97.6 ha). Sequential DA is used to improve the canopy development simulation, which is validated by comparing time-series of net ecosystem exchange (NEE) predictions to independent eddy covariance observations at multiple European cereal crop sites. From assimilating all EO LAI estimates, results indicated adjustments in LAI and, through an enhanced representation of C exchanges, the predicted at-harvest cumulative NEE was improved for all sites by an average of 69% when compared to the model without DA. However, using radar sensors, being relatively unaffected by cloud cover and more sensitive to the structural properties of crops, further improvements were achieved when compared to the combined, and individual, use of optical data. Speciﬁcally, when assimilating radar LAI estimates only, the cumulative NEE estimation was improved by 79% when compared to the simulation without DA.

As the cropland expansion took place in Brazil the last decades, leading to significant land-use change and environmental impacts, detailed information about soils is fundamental for sustainable development. Thus, considering the lack of spatially explicit information about cropland soils in Brazil, we aimed at performing high-resolution mapping of key topsoil attributes using spectral and terrain features extracted from Earth observation data (EOD). With the resulting information, we also aimed at performing a general examination of the main agricultural regions and estimate the total organic carbon stocks on croplands soils. For this, we obtained environmental predictors from the historical collection of Landsat data and the digital elevation model from Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission at the cloud-based platform of Google Earth Engine. The environmental predictors (30 m spatial resolution) with georeferenced soil samples (n = 5097) were used for predicting the topsoil content (0–20 cm) of clay, sand, silt, cation exchange capacity, pH, soil organic carbon (SOC) and SOC stock. Prediction models of clay, sand, SOC content, and SOC stocks had the best performance metrics, achieving a R2 ranging from 0.44 to 0.74 and ratio of performance to the interquartile range higher than 1.5. The predicted maps revealed the variability of topsoil among the cropped areas, indicating that the agricultural expansion took place on sandy soils. The SOC stock map provided consistent estimates compared to previous datasets but revealed additional information at the local and regional scales.

These attributes are relevant for the preservation and proper management of land use in the pursuit of a sustainable agriculture. Laboratory and satellite sensors have been applied as a powerful tool for studying so is, but their analysis using these sensors has mainly focused on the visible (Vis), near infrared (NIR) and shortwave infrared (SWIR) regions of the electromagnetic spectrum, with few studies in the Medium Infrared (MIR). The aim of this study was to identify the spectral pattern of soils with diﬀerent granulometry (sand and clay) and OC content using laboratory and satellite sensors in the MIR region, speciﬁcally in the Thermal Infrared (TIR) range (ASTER, Landsat satellites). The study performed qualitative and quantitative analyses of clay, OC and sand fractions (ﬁne and coarse). The study area is located in the region of Piracicaba, São Paulo, Brazil, where collected 150 soil samples (0–20 cm depth). Soil texture was determined by the pipette method and OC via dry combustion. Reﬂectance and emissivity (Ɛ) spectral data were obtained with the Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) Alpha sensor (Bruker Optics Corporation). An image “ASTER_05” from July 15, 2017 was acquired with values of Ɛ. Samples were separated by textural classes and the spectral behavior in the TIR region was described. The data obtained by the laboratory sensor were resampled to the satellite sensor bands. The behavior between spectra of both sensors was similar and had signiﬁcant correlation with the studied attributes, mainly sand. For the partial least squares regression (PLSR) models, six strategies were used (MIR, MIR_ASTER, ASTER, TIR, TIR Correlation Index (TIR_CID), and MIR Correlation Index (MIR_CID)), which consisted in the use of all sensors bands, or by the selection of bands that presented the most signiﬁcant correlations with each one of the attributes. Models presented a good performance in the prediction of all attributes using the whole MIR. In the TIR region, the models for total sand content and for ﬁne and coarse fractions were good. Models created with ASTER sensor data were not as promising as those with laboratory ones. The use of speciﬁc bands was useful in estimating some attributes in the MIR and TIR, improving the predictive performance and validation of models.

Sicily is an extremely variable region with a high number of ecosystems, soils, and microclimates. We studied the role of time and land use in the modelling of SOC, and assessed the role of remote sensing (RS) covariates in the boosted regression trees modelling. The models obtained showed a high pseudo-R2 (0.63–0.69) and low uncertainty (s.d. b 0.76 g C kg−1 with RS, and b1.25 g C kg−1 without RS). These outputs allowed depicting a time variation of SOC at 1 arcsec. SOC estimation strongly depended on the soil texture, land use, rainfall and topographic indices related to erosion and deposition. RS indices captured one fifth of the total variance explained, slightly changed the ranking of variance explained by the non-RS predictors, and reduced the variability of the model replicates. During the study period, SOC decreased in the areas with relatively high initial SOC, and increased in the area with high temperature and low rainfall, dominated by arables.  This was likely due to the compulsory application of some Good Agricultural and Environmental practices. These results confirm that the importance of texture and land use in short-term SOC variation is comparable to climate.

This review presents a short description of each form of soil degradation, including data regarding known extents and rates, and then reviews the methods with respect to direct and indirect modelling approaches. Two types of obstacles to achieving wide regional detection of soil degradation are revealed. The first concerns the complex and non-unique relationships between remote-sensing indicators and different soil properties, such as roughness, soil moisture (SM), soil salinity, and organic matter content. The second concerns the difficulties involved in acquiring data on subsurface soil properties. In view of these difficulties, we recommend expanding the use of phenomenological models capable of estimating soil-degradation potential according to combinations of environmental conditions, thus enabling remote-sensing efforts to be focused on local areas where the environmental threat is highest. The second avenue for improving the contribution of remote sensing on a wide regional scale involves the application of integrative methods, such as those based on hyperspectral, multisensory, and multitemporal approaches, as well as those that incorporate environmental information (such as topography, soil types, and precipitation).",9/10/13,9/1/22 17:07,9/1/22 17:07,9/1/22 17:07,6152-6181,,17,34,,International Journal of Remote Sensing,Monitoring of agricultural soil degradation by remote-sensing methods,,,,,,,en,,,,,DOI.org (Crossref),,,,/Users/luciananieto/Zotero/storage/A5JWVCJC/Shoshany et al. - 2013 - Monitoring of agricultural soil degradation by rem.pdf

We used single-date and multi-temporal images (SYSI, Synthetic Soil Images) of bare soil pixels from the Sentinel2-MultiSpectral Instrument (S2-MSI) and the Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (L8-OLI) to conduct this research. Two SYSIs were obtained from images acquired in four years (2016–2019) for each satellite (SYSI S2-MSI and SYSI L8-OLI) and a third SYSI, named SYSI Combined, was obtained by combining the images from both satellites. The singledate images for each satellite was acquired in September, when the influence of clouds was low and bare soil pixels was predominant. Single-date images and SYSIs were compared by means of their spectral patterns and ability to predict topsoil properties (clay, sand, silt, and organic matter contents and soil color) using the Cubist algorithm. We found that the SYSIs outperformed single-date images and that the SYSI Combined and SYSI L8OLI provided the best prediction performances.

Since variability of SOC is mainly attributed to biophysical land surface variables, integrating a compressive set of such indices may support the pursuit of an optimum set of predictor variables. Therefore, this study was aimed at predicting the spatial distribution of SOC in relation to remotely sensed variables and other covariates. Hence, the land surface variables were combined from remote sensing, topographic, and soil spectral sources. Moreover, the most inﬂuential variables for prediction were selected using the random forest (RF) and classiﬁcation and regression tree (CART). The results indicated that the RF model has good prediction performance with corresponding R2 and root-mean-square error (RMSE) values of 0.96 and 0.91 mg·g 1, respectively. The distribution of SOC content showed variability across landforms (CV = 78.67%), land use (CV = 93%), and lithology (CV = 64.67%). Forestland had the highest SOC (13.60 mg·g 1) followed by agriculture (10.43 mg·g 1), urban (9.74 mg·g 1), and water body (4.55 mg·g 1) land uses. Furthermore, soils developed in bauxite and laterite lithology had the highest SOC content (14.69 mg·g 1). The SOC content was remarkably lower in soils developed in sandstones; however, the values obtained in soils from the rest of the lithologies could not be signiﬁcantly differentiated. The mean SOC concentration was 11.70 mg·g 1, where the majority of soils in the study area were classiﬁed as highly humus and extremely humus. The soils with the highest SOC content (extremely humus) were distributed in the mountainous regions of the study area. The biophysical land surface indices, brightness removed vegetation indices, topographic indices, and soil spectral bands were the most inﬂuential predictors of SOC in the study area. The spatial variability of SOC may be inﬂuenced by landform, land use, and lithology of the study area. Remotely sensed predictors including land moisture, land surface temperature, and built-up indices added valuable information for the prediction of SOC. Hence, the land surface indices may provide new insights into SOC modeling in complex landscapes of warm subtropical urban regions.",4/27/21,9/1/22 17:07,9/1/22 17:07,9/1/22 17:07,1682,,9,13,,Remote Sensing,,,,,,,,en,,,,,DOI.org (Crossref),,,,/Users/luciananieto/Zotero/storage/ZRMZ2ZKY/Sodango et al. - 2021 - Modeling the Spatial Dynamics of Soil Organic Carb.pdf

Here we proposed a method to extract the informative spectral subset based on spectral characteristics of soil constituents, which was then used to estimate SOM content with PLSR. Genetic algorithm (GA) and variable importance in the projection (VIP) score of PLSR were adopted to further select spectral bands separately. Both laboratory spectra of soil samples collected from an agricultural area and a hyperspectral satellite image were used to evaluate the performance of the method. For the estimations of SOM content using laboratory spectra, compared with the estimation using the entire spectral region of 400–2400 nm, the model accuracy was improved by using the spectral bands associated with clay minerals and the combined spectral bands of organic matter and clay minerals. For the estimations using soil spectra from hyperspectral remote sensing image, the RMSE and R2 values were improved from 0.91% and 0.34 to 0.55% and 0.76 by using the spectral bands associated with organic matter in comparison with the entire spectral region of 390–1029 nm.

However, measuring GPP at these scales remains a major challenge. Solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) is a signal emitted directly from the core of photosynthetic machinery. SIF integrates complex plant physiological functions in vivo to reflect photosynthetic dynamics in real time. The advent of satellite SIF observation promises a new era in global photosynthesis research. The Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) SIF product is a serendipitous but critically complementary by-product of OCO-2’s primary mission target—atmospheric column CO                 2                 (                                                                                                         X                                                                                                                CO                                                          2                                                                                                                                                     ). OCO-2 SIF removes some important roadblocks that prevent wide and in-depth applications of satellite SIF data sets and offers new opportunities for studying the SIF-GPP relationship and vegetation functional gradients at different spatiotemporal scales.                                                        RATIONALE               Compared with earlier satellite missions with SIF capability, the OCO-2 SIF product has substantially improved spatial resolution, data acquisition, and retrieval precision. These improvements allow satellite SIF data to be validated, for the first time, directly against ground and airbornee measurements and also used to investigate the SIF-GPP relationship and terrestrial ecosystem functional dynamics with considerably better spatiotemporal credibility.                                         RESULTS                                Coordinated airbornee measurements of SIF with the Chlorophyll Fluorescence Imaging Spectrometer (CFIS) were used to validate OCO-2 retrievals. The validation shows close agreement between OCO-2 and CFIS SIF, with a regression slope of 1.02 and                 R                 2                 of 0.71. Landscape gradients in SIF emission, corresponding to differences in vegetation types, were clearly delineated by OCO-2, a capability that was lacking in previous satellite missions. The SIF-GPP relationships at eddy covariance flux sites in the vicinity of OCO-2 orbital tracks were found to be more consistent across biomes than previously suggested. Finally, empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analyses on OCO-2 SIF and available GPP products show highly consistent spatiotemporal correspondence in their leading EOF modes across the globe, suggesting that SIF and GPP are governed by similar dynamics and controlled by similar environmental and biological conditions.                                                        CONCLUSION                                OCO-2 represents a major advance in satellite SIF remote sensing. Our analyses suggest that SIF is a powerful proxy for GPP at multiple spatiotemporal scales and that high-quality satellite SIF is of central importance to studying terrestrial ecosystems and the carbon cycle. Although the possibility of a universal SIF-GPP relationship across different biome types cannot be dismissed, in-depth process-based studies are needed to unravel the true nature of covariations between SIF and GPP. Of critical importance in such efforts are the potential coordinated dynamics between the light-use efficiencies of CO                 2                 assimilation and fluorescence emission in response to changes in climate and vegetation characteristics. Eventual synergistic uses of SIF with atmospheric CO                 2                 enabled by OCO-2 will lead to more reliable estimates of terrestrial carbon sources and sinks—when, where, why, and how carbon is exchanged between land and atmosphere—as well as a deeper understanding of carbon-climate feedbacks.

Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2)’s SIF data acquisition and fine spatial resolution permit direct validation against ground and airbornee observations. Empirical orthogonal function analysis shows consistent spatiotemporal correspondence between OCO-2 SIF and GPP globally.

Although its primary mission is to measure the column-averaged mixing ratio of CO2 (Xco2) to constrain global carbon source/sink distribution, one of the OCO-2 spectrometers allows for a robust SIF retrieval solely based on solar Fraunhofer lines. Here we present a technical overview of the OCO-2 SIF product, aiming to provide the scientiﬁc community guidance on best practices for data analysis, interpretation, and application. This overview consists of the retrieval algorithms, OCO-2 speciﬁc bias correction, retrieval uncertainty evaluation, cross-mission comparison with other existing SIF products, and a global-scale examination of the SIF-GPP relationship. With the initial three years of data (September 2014 onward), we compared OCO-2 SIF with retrievals from Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite (GOSAT) and Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment-2 (GOME-2), and examined its relationship with FLUXCOM and MODIS GPP datasets. Our results show that OCO-2 SIF, along with GOSAT products, closely resemble the mean spatial and temporal patterns of FLUXCOM GPP from regions to the globe. Compared with GOME-2, however, OCO-2 depicts a more realistic spatial contrast between the tropics and extra-tropics. The linear relationship between OCO-2 SIF and existing modeled GPP products diverges somewhat across biomes at the global scale, consistent with previous GOSAT or GOME-2 based ﬁndings when modeled GPP products were used, but in contrast to a consistent cross-biome SIF-GPP relationship obtained at ﬂux tower sites with OCO-2 products. This contrast suggests a critical need to reconcile diﬀerences in diverse SIF and GPP products and the relationships among them. Overall, the OCO-2 SIF products are robust and valuable for monitoring the global terrestrial carbon cycle and for constraining the carbon source/sink strengths of the Earth system.

Spatio-temporal fields of land–atmosphere fluxes derived from data-driven models can complement simulations by process-based land surface models. While a number of strategies for empirical models with eddy-covariance flux data have been applied, a systematic intercomparison of these methods has been missing so far. In this study, we performed a cross-validation experiment for predicting carbon dioxide, latent heat, sensible heat and net radiation fluxes across different ecosystem types with 11 machine learning (ML) methods from four different classes (kernel methods, neural networks, tree methods, and regression splines). We applied two complementary setups: (1) 8-day average fluxes based on remotely sensed data and (2) daily mean fluxes based on meteorological data and a mean seasonal cycle of remotely sensed variables. The patterns of predictions from different ML and experimental setups were highly consistent. There were systematic differences in performance among the fluxes, with the following ascending order: net ecosystem exchange (R2 < 0.5), ecosystem respiration (R2 > 0.6), gross primary production (R2> 0.7), latent heat (R2 > 0.7), sensible heat (R2 > 0.7), and net radiation (R2 > 0.8). The ML methods predicted the across-site variability and the mean seasonal cycle of the observed fluxes very well (R2 > 0.7), while the 8-day deviations from the mean seasonal cycle were not well predicted (R2 < 0.5).

Cross-validated partial least squares regression (PLSR) models were constructed between soil reﬂectance image spectra, and SOC content analyzed from 329 top soil samples collected over the study area. Cross-validation R2 ranged from 0.005 to 0.58, root mean square error from 5.86 to 3.02 g·kg−1 and residual prediction deviation values from 1.0 to 1.5 (without unit), according to date. The main factors inﬂuencing these diﬀerences were soil roughness, in conjunction with soil moisture, and the cloud and cloud shadow cover of the entire tile. The best performing dates were spring dates characterized by both lowest soil surface roughness and moisture content. Normalized diﬀerence vegetation index (NDVI) values below 0.35 did not inﬂuence prediction performance. This consolidates the previous results obtained during single date acquisitions and oﬀers wider perspectives for the further use of Sentinel-2 into multidate mosaics for digital soil mapping.",9/14/19,9/1/22 17:17,9/1/22 17:17,9/1/22 17:17,2143,,18,11,,Remote Sensing,,,,,,,,en,,,,,DOI.org (Crossref),,,,/Users/luciananieto/Zotero/storage/27EYKD5L/Vaudour et al. - 2019 - The Impact of Acquisition Date on the Prediction P.pdf

Digital SOC mapping is essential for agricultural production management. Digital SOC mapping based on multisource remote sensing data has been integrated well into prediction models and methodological approaches on different mapping scales. However, the mixed use of synthetic images and the application of the hybrid model considering the soil classification probability are rare. Here, we propose a probability hybrid model to estimate and map SOC content and distribution. Multi-temporal synthetic images were used to build the probability hybrid model. One hundred forty topsoil samples were collected in Suihua, a city in a typical black soil region in China. Cloud-free Sentinel-2 images were acquired from the bare soil periods between 2018 and 2021. Minimum, maximum, mean, and median synthetic images were calculated using single images from the same period. The random forest and support vector machine models were used for discriminating soil class and calculating soil classification probability, and then random forest regression model was applied to SOC mapping. Soil class mapping and classification probability were performed for Phaeozems, Chernozems, and Cambisols of the World Reference Base for Soil Resources (WRB) based on soil texture, climatic factors, and the normalized differential vegetation index (NDVI). Based on soil class mapping results, global models using single temporal images and multi-temporal images, the hybrid model using multi-temporal images for the three soil classes as well as a probability hybrid model using multi-temporal images were built and compared their SOC predictions. Our study showed that (1) Phaeozems, Chernozems and Cambisols could be classified accurately, and the overall validation accuracy of random forest model was 91.67%. (2) The correlations of SOC with bands and band indices improved using multi-temporal images, and the use of mixed synthetic images was better than the use of only one synthetic image. (3) The hybrid model performed far better than the global models, and the probability hybrid model led to the highest prediction accuracy, a validation R2 of 0.77 and an RMSE of 2.30 g kg−1. (4) The probability hybrid model was more accurate than the original hybrid model for digital SOC mapping, and the SOC distribution in boundary regions was smoother and more continuous.

Reflectance spectroscopy has proven to be a promising technique for SOC quantification in the laboratory and increasingly from air- and spacebornee platforms, where hyperspectral imagery provides great potential for mapping SOC on larger scales with regular updates. When applied on larger scales, soil prediction accuracy decreases due to the inhomogeneity of samples. In this paper, we examined if spectral clustering of the LUCAS EU-wide topsoil database is successful without using other covariates than the spectral database and can improve SOC model performance compared to a reference model that was calibrated on the whole database without clustering. Different clustering methodologies were tested, including a k-means clustering based on principal component analysis or based on spectral feature variables, combined with partial least squares regression (PLSR) models, and a clustering based on a local PLSR approach which builds a different multivariate model for each sample to be predicted. Furthermore, in order to allow for subsequent application to hyperspectral remote sensing data, atmospheric water wavelengths were removed from the analyses. The local PLSR approach achieved best results and was additionally applied to LUCAS spectra resampled to the upcoming hyperspectral EnMAP sensor which led to good results: R2 = 0.66, RMSEP = 5.78 g kg−1 and RPIQ = 1.93. The k-means clustering approach showed slightly better results than the reference model. Overall, our results showed similar performances for SOC prediction models compared to other approaches using PLSR with a larger spectral range and other soil parameters as covariates. This study shows that (i) it is possible to transfer the local PLSR approach onto a wavelengths reduced spectral library and to predict estimations of SOC at low-cost with reasonable accuracy based on large scale soil databases; and (ii) that the local regression approach is a valuable tool for SOC prediction models based solely on spectral data without the use of other soil covariates.",2019-11,9/1/22 17:07,9/1/22 17:07,9/1/22 17:07,297-307,,,353,,Geoderma,,,,,,,,en,,,,,DOI.org (Crossref),,,,/Users/luciananieto/Zotero/storage/4XJI7Q6A/Ward et al. - 2019 - A remote sensing adapted approach for soil organic.pdf

Contemporary Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) carrying low-cost and lightweight multispectral sensors provide high spatial resolution imagery (<10 cm). These capabilities allow integrate of UAS-derived soil data and maps into digitalized workﬂows for sustainable agriculture. However, the common situation of scarce soil data at ﬁeld scale might be an obstacle for accurate digital soil mapping. In our case study we tested a ﬁxed-wing UAS equipped with visible and near infrared (VIS-NIR) sensors to estimate topsoil SOC distribution at two ﬁelds under the constraint of limited sampling points, which were selected by pedological knowledge. They represent all releva nt soil types along an erosiondeposition gradient; hence, the full feature space in terms of topsoils’ SOC status. We included the Topographic Position Index (TPI) as a co-variate for SOC prediction. Our study was performed in a soil landscape of hummocky ground moraines, which represent a signiﬁcant of global arable land. Herein, small scale soil variability is mainly driven by tillage erosion which, in turn, is strongly dependent on topography. Relationships between SOC, TPI and spectral information were tested by Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) using: (i) single ﬁeld data (local approach) and (ii) data from both ﬁelds (pooled approach). The highest prediction performance determined by a leaveone-out-cross-validation (LOOCV) was obtained for the models using the reﬂectance at 570 nm in conjunction with the TPI as explanatory variables for the local approach (coefﬁcient of determination (R2) = 0.91; root mean square error (RMSE) = 0.11% and R2 = 0.48; RMSE = 0.33, respectively). The local MLR models developed with both reﬂectance and TPI using values from all points showed high correlations and low prediction errors for SOC content (R2 = 0.88, RMSE = 0.07%; R2 = 0.79, RMSE = 0.06%, respectively). The comparison with an enlarged dataset consisting of all points from both ﬁelds (pooled approach) showed no improvement of the prediction accuracy but yielded decreased prediction errors. Lastly, the local MLR models were applied to the data of the respective other ﬁeld to evaluate the cross-ﬁeld prediction ability. The spatial SOC pattern generally remains unaffected on both ﬁelds; differences, however, occur concerning the predicted SOC level. Our results indicate a high potential of the combination of UAS-based remote sensing and environmental covariates, such as terrain attributes, for the prediction of topsoil SOC content at the ﬁeld scale. The temporal ﬂexibility of UAS offer the opportunity to optimize ﬂight conditions including weather and soil surface status (plant cover or residuals, moisture and roughness) which, otherwise, might obscure the relationship between spectral data and SOC content.

Therefore, integrating cropping systems and natural factors can improve the accuracy of mapping farmland SOCD. This study aimed to obtain and incorporate cropping system information in mapping SOCD in plains by combining normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time-series data and the regression Kriging (RK) method. We collected 230 topsoil samples in Jianghan Plain, China and (i) obtained the spatial patterns of crops in summer and winter using NDVI time-series data derived from HJ-1A/1B satellite images, (ii) investigated the differences in SOCD under different cropping systems, and (iii) evaluated the performance of the RK_CS model in integrating cropping systems and natural factors into mapping SOCD. ANOVA results showed signiﬁcant differences in SOCD under different cropping systems. Speciﬁcally, the SOCD of single rice was higher than that of rice–wheat rotation and dry crops. Meanwhile, the regression results showed that SOCD was affected by natural factors and cropping system, with the latter playing a major role. The integration of soil types, slope and cropping systems explained approximately 26.3% of the variation in SOCD. Model validation results conﬁrmed the effectiveness of the RK_CS model.

The availability of satellite observations of the land surface since the 1970s, particularly the early 1980s, has made it feasible to quantify ecosystem carbon fluxes and stocks at regional to global scales. Here we provide a review of the advances in remote sensing of the terrestrial carbon cycle from the early 1970s to present. First, we present an overview of the terrestrial carbon cycle and remote sensing of carbon fluxes and stocks. Remote sensing data acquired in a broad wavelength range (visible, infrared, and microwave) of the electromagnetic spectrum have been used to estimate carbon fluxes and/or stocks. Second, we provide a historical overview of the key milestones in remote sensing of the terrestrial carbon cycle. Third, we review the platforms/sensors, methods, findings, and challenges in remote sensing of carbon fluxes. The remote sensing data and techniques used to quantify carbon fluxes include vegetation indices, light use efficiency models, terrestrial biosphere models, data-driven (or machine learning) approaches, solarinduced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF), land surface temperature, and atmospheric inversions. Fourth, we review the platforms/sensors, methods, findings, and challenges in passive optical, microwave, and lidar remote sensing of biomass carbon stocks as well as remote sensing of soil organic carbon. Fifth, we review the progresses in remote sensing of disturbance impacts on the carbon cycle. Sixth, we also discuss the uncertainty and validation of the resulting carbon flux and stock estimates.

As a result, a global FAPAR product (denoted by GLASS) was generated from the GLASS LAI data from 2000. With no missing values, GLASS FAPAR product is spatially complete.

However, there were relatively large discrepancies between these FAPAR products in equatorial forest regions and around 50–60°N, where the SeaWiFS FAPAR values were lower than the other products and GLASS FAPAR product showed the largest values.

Crop species/crop rotations and agricultural management signiﬁcantly aﬀect the spatial variation of SOC in croplands. For areas where climatic conditions and farming managements are generally consistent in cultivation territory of one crop species, crop phenology largely indicates the crop response to soil. Therefore, phenological parameters incorporating with crop rotation could be eﬀective for mapping soil organic carbon in these areas. In this study, we extracted phenological parameters from Normalized Diﬀerence Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series data, and used these variables with crop rotation for predicting topsoil organic carbon content in a cropland area in Anhui province, China. Forty-nine sampling points were collected in ﬁeld. For these points, there were three crop rotations each with two crop species per year. Twenty-two HJ-1 A/B images for 2010 year with a 30 m resolution were obtained. Eleven phenological parameters for each of the two growing seasons were obtained with a dynamic threshold method.

The prediction results were validated using a cross validation approach. Results showed that base levels (given as the average of the left and right minimum values of a time series proﬁle) for both seasons were the most important predictors in this area.

These environmental factors include soil hydrothermal factors (soil moisture content and soil temperature), topographic factors (elevation and slope) and vegetation factor (NDVI). The original band reflectivity (OR) of Landsat 8 OLI images and the band reflectivity after the first-order derivative (FDR) and the second-order derivative (SDR) processing were combined with the above environmental factors to estimate SOM content. The results showed that the accuracy of the model was improved obviously by adding environmental factors. The estimation effect of back propagation neural network (BPNN) model was better than that of geographically weighted regression (GWR) model, partial least squares regression (PLSR) model and multivariable linear regression (MLR) model. GWR model can also meet the estimation requirements, while PLSR and MLR models cannot achieve effectively the estimation of SOM content. FDR-BPNN model considering environmental factors was the best model for estimating SOM content, with R2 being 0.947, RMSEC being 4.701 g⋅kg−1 and MAEV being 5.485 g⋅kg−1. Moreover, the model had the lowest uncertainty and the highest stability. This study will provide a good insight for the monitoring of SOM content in the future, and provide basic data support for the implementation of precision agriculture in the QTP.",2021-06,9/1/22 17:07,9/1/22 17:07,9/1/22 17:07,106144,,,185,,Computers and Electronics in Agriculture,Improving estimation of soil organic matter content by combining Landsat 8 OLI images and environmental data,,,,,,,en,,,,,DOI.org (Crossref),,,,/Users/luciananieto/Zotero/storage/N862ETPL/Yu et al. - 2021 - Improving estimation of soil organic matter conten.pdf

This paper presents results from the SolumScire project, focusing on the prediction of the spatial distribution of soil zones and topsoil properties, such as pH, soil organic matter (SOM) and clay content in agricultural ﬁelds through random forest algorithms.

Generally, the most commonly used covariates (MCC; e.g., topographic attributes and single-time remote sensing data, and legacy maps) were employed in DSM studies. Additionally, remote sensing time-series (RST) data can provide useful information for soil mapping. Therefore, the main aims of the study are to compare the MCC, the monthly Sentinel-2 time-series of vegetation indices dataset, and the combination of datasets (MCC + RST) for soil organic carbon (SOC) prediction in an arid agroecosystem in Iran. We used different machine learning algorithms, including random forest (RF), Cubist, support vector machine (SVM), and partial least square regression (PLSR). A total of 237 soil samples at 0–20 cm depths were collected. The 5-fold cross-validation technique was used to evaluate the modeling performance, and 50 bootstrap models were applied to quantify the prediction uncertainty. The results showed that the Cubist model performed the best with the MCC dataset (R2 = 0.35, RMSE = 0.26%) and the combined dataset of MCC and RST (R2 = 0.33, RMSE = 0.27%), while the RF model showed better results for the RST dataset (R2 = 0.10, RMSE = 0.31%). Soil properties could explain the SOC variation in MCC and combined datasets (66.35% and 50.82%, respectively), while NDVI was the most controlling factor in the RST (50.22%). Accordingly, results showed that time-series vegetation indices did not have enough potential to increase SOC prediction accuracy. However, the combination of MCC and RST datasets produced SOC spatial maps with lower uncertainty. Therefore, future studies are required to explicitly explain the efficiency of time-series remotely-sensed data and their interrelationship with environmental covariates to predict SOC in arid regions with low SOC content.",2022-01,9/1/22 17:07,9/1/22 17:07,9/1/22 17:07,105723,,,208,,CATENA,Improving the spatial prediction of soil organic carbon using environmental covariates selection,,,,,,,en,,,,,DOI.org (Crossref),,,,/Users/luciananieto/Zotero/storage/JQSUSF89/Zeraatpisheh et al. - 2022 - Improving the spatial prediction of soil organic c.pdf

Recent developments in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) combined with miniaturized visible–near infrared spectrometers have enabled the rapid and low-cost field-scale SOC mapping. However, a field-specific spectrotransfer model is often needed for such UAV-based hyperspectral measurements, implying local sampling and model development are still required, and this hampers the widespread application of UAV-based methods. In this study, we aim to test to what extent SOC prediction models derived from an existing regional soil spectral library (SSL) can be applied to UAV-based hyperspectral data, without the need for additional field sampling. To this end, an UAV survey was conducted over a bare cropland within the Belgian Loam Belt for field-scale SOC mapping. We evaluated two calibration approaches, one based on local sampling and model development, and one where we capitalized on an existing (laboratory-based) regional SSL. For the local calibration approach, we obtained a good prediction performance with RMSE of 0.57 g kgÀ1 and RPIQ of 2.35. For the regional model, a spectral alignment procedure was needed to resolve the discrepancy between UAVand laboratory-based measurements. This resulted in a fair SOC prediction accuracy with RMSE of 0.93 g kgÀ1 and RPIQ of 1.45. The comparison of SOC maps derived from the two approaches, along with an external validation showed a high consistency, indicating that UAV-based spectral measurements, in combination with SSLs have the potential to improve the efficiency of high-resolution SOC mapping.",2021-09,9/1/22 17:07,9/1/22 17:07,9/1/22 17:07,4375-4389,,15,32,,Land Degrad Dev,"Evaluating the capability of a <span style=""font-variant",,,,,,,en,,,,,DOI.org (Crossref),,,,/Users/luciananieto/Zotero/storage/TI8RTCHX/Zhang et al. - 2021 - Evaluating the capability of a span style=font-v.pdf

Several recent studies have demonstrated the strong link between GPP and space-borne retrievals of SIF at broad scales. However, critical gaps remain between short-term small-scale mechanistic understanding and seasonal global observations. Here, we present a model-based analysis of the relationship between SIF and GPP across scales for diverse vegetation types and a range of meteorological conditions, with the ultimate focus on reproducing the environmental conditions during remote sensing measurements. The coupled ﬂuorescence-photosynthesis model SCOPE is used to simulate GPP and SIF at the both leaf and canopy levels for 13 ﬂux sites. Analyses were conducted to investigate the effects of temporal scaling, canopy structure, overpass time, and spectral domain on the relationship between SIF and GPP. The simulated SIF is highly non-linear with GPP at the leaf level and instantaneous time scale and tends to linearize when scaling to the canopy level and daily to seasonal. These relationships are consistent across a wide range of vegetation types. The relationship between SIF and GPP is primarily driven by absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (APAR), especially at the seasonal scale, although the photosynthetic efﬁciency also contributes to strengthen the link between them. The linearization of their relationship from leaf to canopy and averaging over time is because the overall conditions of the canopy fall within the range of the linear responses of GPP and SIF to light and the photosynthetic capacity. Our results further show that the top-of-canopy relationships between simulated SIF and GPP have similar linearity regardless of whether we used the morning or midday satellite overpass times. Field measurements conﬁrmed these ﬁndings. In addition, the simulated red SIF at 685 nm has a similar relationship with GPP as that of far-red SIF at 740 nm at the canopy level. These ﬁndings provide model-based evidence to interpret remotely sensed SIF data and their relationship with GPP.",2016-12,9/1/22 17:15,9/1/22 17:15,9/1/22 17:15,145-155,,,187,,Remote Sensing of Environment,,,,,,,,en,,,,,DOI.org (Crossref),,,,/Users/luciananieto/Zotero/storage/SE89ZZDQ/Zhang et al. - 2016 - Model-based analysis of the relationship between s.pdf

A total of 201 topsoil samples (0–20 cm) from the Northeastern Black Soil Region of China were also used. Then, the relationships between the two soil properties and indicators were analyzed. The indicators that showed significant correlation with SOC or soil pH were involved in the subsequent models. Finally, the SOC and soil pH prediction models were constructed by using a stepwise regression model. The results showed that the visible and shortwave infrared bands, along with the thermal infrared band, had strong correlations with the two soil properties.

However, there is still substantial uncertainty in the magnitude, spatial distribution, and temporal dynamics of GPP. Using light use eﬃciency (LUE) models, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of the uncertainty in GPP estimation resulting from various sources: model structure, model parameters, input data, and spatial resolution. We ﬁrst evaluated the inﬂuences of model structures, namely the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (FPAR), water scalar (WS), and temperature scalar (TS), on site-level GPP estimates. We then used the Sobol’ sensitivity analysis to quantify the relative contributions of model input variables to the uncertainty in GPP. In addition, we used diﬀerent land cover and meteorological datasets to examine the eﬀects of input data and spatial resolution on the magnitude and spatiotemporal patterns of GPP. We found that the model structures aﬀected not only model performance but also model parameters in a manner that diﬀered with vegetation type and region. Thus, proper model structures and rigorous model parameterization and calibration should be adopted in GPP modeling. The Sobol’ sensitivity analysis showed that the meteorological drivers including photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and daily minimum temperature (TMIN) had larger contribution to the uncertainty in simulated GPP than did the surface reﬂectance-based indices including enhanced vegetation index (EVI) and normalized diﬀerence water index (NDWI). At the regional scale, diﬀerent land cover datasets had the largest impacts on GPP simulations, especially in heterogeneous areas, followed by the scale eﬀects from diﬀerent spatial resolutions; changing meteorological datasets had the smallest eﬀects. Therefore, more accurate and ﬁner-resolution land cover maps and meteorological datasets are essential for more accurate GPP estimates.

The spatial data of SOC, slope, soil water content (SWC), soil bulk density (SBD), sand, silt, and Landsat 8 remote sensing reﬂectance (Rrs) were extracted at 330 m interval along three transects in the arable land of Taiyuan basin, China. The spatial series of SOC and environmental variables along each of three transects were separated into six detail components and one approximation representing diﬀerent scales using wavelet decomposition. The speciﬁc scale of each detail component was identiﬁed by Hilbert transform. The SOC variances over the entire basin were mainly explained (54%–86%) by scales of 12.70 and 21.12 km. Compared with the relationships between SOC and environmental factors at sampling scale, their multiscale correlations were better at larger scales. The SOC estimation using wavelet reconstruction based on predicted SOC at all scale components outperformed its prediction using stepwise multiple linear regression (SMLR) based on the original sampling data. The major contributing scale to SOC prediction was 12.70 km over the entire basin. In the prediction of overall SOC, Rrs was the major predictor in the upstream and downstream portions, whereas soil texture was the major contributor in the midstream portion.
