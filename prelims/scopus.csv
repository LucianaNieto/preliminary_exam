Digital SOC mapping is essential for agricultural production management. Digital SOC mapping based on multi-source remote sensing data has been integrated well into prediction models and methodological approaches on different mapping scales. However, the mixed use of synthetic images and the application of the hybrid model considering the soil classification probability are rare. Here, we propose a probability hybrid model to estimate and map SOC content and distribution. Multi-temporal synthetic images were used to build the probability hybrid model. One hundred forty topsoil samples were collected in Suihua, a city in a typical black soil region in China. Cloud-free Sentinel-2 images were acquired from the bare soil periods between 2018 and 2021. Minimum, maximum, mean, and median synthetic images were calculated using single images from the same period. The random forest and support vector machine models were used for discriminating soil class and calculating soil classification probability, and then random forest regression model was applied to SOC mapping. Soil class mapping and classification probability were performed for Phaeozems, Chernozems, and Cambisols of the World Reference Base for Soil Resources (WRB) based on soil texture, climatic factors, and the normalized differential vegetation index (NDVI). Based on soil class mapping results, global models using single temporal images and multi-temporal images, the hybrid model using multi-temporal images for the three soil classes as well as a probability hybrid model using multi-temporal images were built and compared their SOC predictions. Our study showed that (1) Phaeozems, Chernozems and Cambisols could be classified accurately, and the overall validation accuracy of random forest model was 91.67%. (2) The correlations of SOC with bands and band indices improved using multi-temporal images, and the use of mixed synthetic images was better than the use of only one synthetic image. (3) The hybrid model performed far better than the global models, and the probability hybrid model led to the highest prediction accuracy, a validation R2 of 0.77 and an RMSE of 2.30 g kg−1. (4) The probability hybrid model was more accurate than the original hybrid model for digital SOC mapping, and the SOC distribution in boundary regions was smoother and more continuous. Our results suggest that the probability hybrid model has a large potential for SOC prediction and mapping. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Probability hybrid model; Random forest; SOC; Typical black soil regions","Agriculture; Ecosystems; Forecasting; Image enhancement; Organic carbon; Probability distributions; Random forests; Regression analysis; Remote sensing; Soils; Support vector machines; Textures; Vegetation mapping; Black soil regions; Hybrid model; Multi-temporal; Multi-temporal image; Probability hybrid model; Random forests; Soil class; Soil organic carbon; Synthetic images; Typical black soil region; Decision trees; accuracy assessment; agricultural production; bare soil; Cambisol; classification; mapping; model validation; NDVI; Phaeozem; probability; remote sensing; satellite imagery; soil organic matter; China","English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85134890081

The present study proposes for the first time a Digital Soil Mapping (DSM) initiative to map SOC stocks in Tunisian topsoils (0–30 cm) at 100 m resolution, using a Quantile Regression Forest (QRF) algorithm, a range of environmental covariates, and a national database of 1540 SOC stock profiles. Our results provided a revised assessment of the SOC stock on the Tunisian territory at 391Tg C in the first 30 cm of soil profile, i.e. an average of 2.53 kg m-2. The map of SOC stocks outperformed global DSM products such as SoilGrids 2.0 in both R2 (0.44 vs. 0.15) and RMSE (1.94 vs. 2.52 kg m−2) and can be used as a benchmark against changes of land use and climate. The importance of the environmental covariates tested indicates the major role of bioclimatic data and, to a lesser extent, remote sensing images and topography-related variables. Our study did not show a significant added value of using additional covariates in relation to nationally available variables or the SOC map predicted by SoilGrids2.0. Finally, our results showed that increasing the quality and quantity of soil profile observations is most likely the best way to improve the future SOC map, starting with the northern region of Tunisia, which has the highest SOC stock predictions and uncertainties in the country. An alternative way would be the exploration of new covariates through sub-national approaches. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Digital soil mapping; Machine learning spatial prediction; Multiple soil classes; National approach; Quantile regression forest; Soil organic carbon stocks; Tunisian soils",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85133843894

Remote sensing has become an important tool to quantify and display swidden agriculture in transition. Due to its diversity, dynamics, and complexity, however, the development of universal remote sensing algorithms for mapping swidden agriculture faces major challenges. Although swidden agriculture has increasingly become the focus of climate change and other sustainable initiatives, a systematic review on remote sensing of this farming system in the tropics is seldom reported. With 89 peer-reviewed journal articles related to the identification, mapping, monitoring or forecast of swidden agriculture since the 1970s, the methodological progresses and shortcomings of remote sensing of swidden agriculture were compared and summarized, followed by providing several perspectives on near-future research directions. The conclusions were drawn as follows. Firstly, the limited remote sensing studies of swidden agriculture were mostly reported in Southeast Asia (66%), followed by Latin America and Central Africa. Secondly, Landsat is the most (59%) widely applied to monitor swidden agriculture and also holds huge potential in delineating its trajectories. Thirdly, the spectral feature-based algorithms (76%) are more used than the counterparts of geometric-based and structure-based ones. Finally, several aspects including exploring new data and algorithms for the enhancement of remote sensing of swidden agriculture have been proposed. This review paper might be served as a long-delayed appeal for strengthening remote sensing of swidden agriculture in the tropics for accurately assessing the carbon budget of forest change and other ecological and social effects caused by the evolution and transformations of swidden agriculture. © 2022 The Authors","Dry season; Landsat; Slash-and-burn; Spectral feature-based algorithms; Swidden agriculture; The tropics","algorithm; computer simulation; Landsat; remote sensing; satellite data; satellite imagery; Central Africa; Latin America","English",Review,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85133282918

This research aimed at evaluating ML algorithms to predict spatial distribution of soil biological properties and wheat yield in the Southwest of Iran. Topsoil samples (0–30 cm) were collected from a total of 60 sampling locations and wheat grain yield (plot 1 × 1 m) was recorded at each location. Soil properties including urease (Ur), alkaline phosphatase (AP), basal respiration (BR), microbial biomass carbon (MBC), soil organic carbon (SOC), MBC:SOC ratio, and metabolic quotient (qCO2) were measured. At the first step, Random Forest (RF) model was employed to predict soil biological properties by using terrain attributes, remote sensing indices and soil properties as covariates. In this step, both Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) and Pearson regression were applied to select the most important covariates in predicting soil biological properties and to decrease the dimension of the input space with considering no reduction in prediction accuracy. Secondly, wheat grain yield was modeled using six ML algorithms; they were optimized and evaluated in Caret package with 10-fold cross validation. Results showed the highest prediction accuracy for qCO2 (R2adj = 0.80) and the lowest for BR (R2adj = 0.23). Compared to environmental predictors, soil covariates had a greater effect in modeling Ur, qCO2, MBC and MBC:SOC ratio, while, for AP and BR, bands 6 and Chanel Network Base Level were the most important factors, respectively. In prediction of wheat grain yield, both Stochastic Gradient Boosting (SGB) and RF models outperformed with R2adj of 0.89 and 0.88, respectively. Results indicated that the Ur and AP played the major roles in predicting wheat grain yield and explaining its spatial variability. Our modeling results suggested that soil biological properties and yield can be estimated easily with reasonable accuracy.

However, when working across large geographical scales, remote sensing may be more suitable. Acquiring these spectra data normally under different measurement conditions could introduce artefacts that reduce SOC prediction accuracy. A common procedure has been using calibration or multivariate techniques in conjunction with one or more pre-treatment algorithms. The results of several comparative studies based on these predictive calibration techniques used alone were inconsistent. Moreover, protocols to select the most appropriate pre-treatment algorithms rarely exist. This study combines predictions from different techniques into a single model based on an ensemble learning approach. The main objective is to improve the accuracy of SOC prediction by assessing the effectiveness of using different calibration techniques individually against an ensemble model consisting of one statistical method, which includes partial least squares regression (PLSR), and three machine learning (ML) algorithms, including random forest (RF), support vector machine regression (SVMR), and Cubist. Several pre-treatment algorithms were also employed to improve the spectral data before prediction. Spectra data were collected from three different agricultural fields (with different soil types), under different spectral measurement conditions (field, wet and dry). Additionally, Sentinel-2 (S2) data was collected from one of these fields. Furthermore, to ascertain the effectiveness of the developed model on regional scale dataset, two options were employed: (1) merged data from all fields, and (2) merged data from fields measured under the same spectral measurement conditions. The models were evaluated using root mean square error of prediction (RMSEPCV), the coefficient of determination (R²CV), the ratio of performance to interquartile range (RPIQ), the ratio of performance to deviation (RPD) and BIAS. The results show that, across the three agricultural fields, the ensemble model predicted SOC more accurately than each of the individual calibration techniques (R2CV = 0.92, RMSEPCV (g/kg) = 1.00, RPD = 3.06, RPIQ = 3.74, BIAS (g/kg) = 0.067). The models derived from merged data (regional dataset) show that the ensemble approach predicted SOC more accurately with option 2 than option 1. Finally, while the ensemble model improves SOC accuracy with S2 data, the final output was poor. Further research to determine the underlying problem is strongly recommended. Nonetheless, these results indicate that the ensemble model is advantageous because it improved the prediction accuracy of SOC and reduced the error margin. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Agricultural soil; Ensemble predictive model; Pre-treatment; Sentinel-2; Soil organic carbon; Spectroscopy (field-wet-dry)","Agriculture; Calibration; Decision trees; Infrared devices; Learning algorithms; Least squares approximations; Mean square error; Organic carbon; Remote sensing; Soil surveys; Soils; Spectroscopy; Support vector machines; Agricultural soils; Calibration techniques; Ensemble models; Ensemble predictive model; Pre-treatments; Predictive models; Sentinel-2; Soil organic carbon; Spectroscopy (field-wet-dry); Wet dries; Forecasting; imagery; organic carbon; spectroscopy; topsoil; Croatia; Vis","English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85127051045

There are many estimation strategies with the potential for more reliable estimates of SOC stock and more efficient use of soil sampling and analysis resources, especially by leveraging readily available auxiliary information such as remote sensing. However, concrete guidance for strategy selection is lacking. This study narrows this gap with a comparison of strategies for estimating deep SOC stock (0–60 cm) in a prototypical field. Using high density SOC stock measurements and simulation, we built on past studies by 1) ex-ante evaluating a large number of strategy options, 2) using a Bayesian approach to quantify the uncertainty of the comparison, and 3) considering multiple Bayesian models to assess sensitivity to this modeling choice. We found that, using readily available auxiliary information, both balanced and stratified sampling offer substantial improvements over simple random sampling. The auxiliary information most important for this improvement is a Sentinel-2 SOC index = blue / (green × red), followed by the topographic wetness index. We found that these results are robust to the choice of mapping method, but that there is uncertainty in the magnitude of improvement. We recommend future studies implement this Bayesian approach for simulated ex-ante evaluation of SOC stock estimation strategies across more fields to investigate the generalizability of these findings. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Bayesian; Estimation; Evaluation; Geostatistics; Sampling; Soil carbon stocks","Agriculture; Organic carbon; Remote sensing; Soils; Uncertainty analysis; Agricultural fields; Auxiliary information; Bayesian; Bayesian approaches; Estimation strategies; Evaluation; Ex ante evaluation; Geo-statistics; Soil carbon stock; Soil organic Carbon stocks; Bayesian networks; Bayesian analysis; mapping method; organic carbon; sampling; Sentinel; soil carbon; sustainability","English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85122622997

Reflectance spectroscopy has been recognized as a promising method to rapidly estimate SOM content. However, the existing estimation methods mainly apply partial least squares regression (PLSR) to the entire spectral region of hyperspectral data. Here we proposed a method to extract the informative spectral subset based on spectral characteristics of soil constituents, which was then used to estimate SOM content with PLSR. Genetic algorithm (GA) and variable importance in the projection (VIP) score of PLSR were adopted to further select spectral bands separately. Both laboratory spectra of soil samples collected from an agricultural area and a hyperspectral satellite image were used to evaluate the performance of the method. For the estimations of SOM content using laboratory spectra, compared with the estimation using the entire spectral region of 400–2400 nm, the model accuracy was improved by using the spectral bands associated with clay minerals and the combined spectral bands of organic matter and clay minerals. For the estimations using soil spectra from hyperspectral remote sensing image, the RMSE and R2 values were improved from 0.91% and 0.34 to 0.55% and 0.76 by using the spectral bands associated with organic matter in comparison with the entire spectral region of 390–1029 nm.

The indicators including the coefficient of determination (R2) and root - mean – square - error (RMSE) were applied to evaluate the model's performance. A numerous features computed from optical and SAR data fusion were employed to build and test the proposed model performance. The effectiveness of the proposed machine learning model was assessed by comparing with the two well-known algorithms such as Random Forests (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) to predict agricultural SOC. Results suggest that a combination of S1 and S2 sensors could effectively estimate SOC in farming areas by using ML techniques. Satisfactory accuracy of the proposed XGBoost with optimal features was achieved the highest performance (R2 = 0.870; RMSE = 1.818 tonC/ha) which outperformed RF and SVM. Thus, multi-sensor data fusion combined with the XGBoost lead to the best prediction results for agricultural SOC at 10 m spatial resolution. In short, this new approach could significantly contribute to various agricultural SOC retrieval studies globally. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Machine learning; Multi-sensor data fusion; Sentinel 1; Sentinel 2; SOC","Adaptive boosting; Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Decision trees; Forecasting; Land use; Organic carbon; Remote sensing; Sensor data fusion; Soil surveys; Soils; Synthetic aperture radar; Active Learning; Agricultural soils; Machine learning models; Modeling performance; Multi sensors data fusion; Radar data fusion; Root mean square errors; Sentinel 2; Sentinel-1; Soil organic carbon; Support vector machines; organic carbon; carbon; agricultural soil; machine learning; organic carbon; sensor; Sentinel; soil carbon; spatial resolution; synthetic aperture radar; agriculture; Article; decision tree; imaging; learning algorithm; machine learning; mathematical parameters; multispectral data; nonhuman; prediction; random forest; remote sensing; root mean squared error; SAR data; soil; support vector machine; vegetation; agriculture; intelligence; machine learning; telecommunication; Australia; Western Australia; Varanidae; Agriculture; Carbon; Intelligence; Machine Learning; Radar; Soil","English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114661978

Agriculture being a predominant global land use, C sequestration under different agro-ecosystems through appropriate management practices is an important option to combat the anthropogenic climate change. Conservation tillage along with residue management, stubble retention, mulching, organic farming and integrated nutrient management not only facilitates soil C storage but also improves soil health. Change in land-uses and cropping system also impart notable effects on soil C turnover. Biochar application is found effective in augmenting soil C stock and improving soil aggregation. Bioenergy plantations are also effective in sequestering C. Simulation models and remote sensing are innovative tools for predicting and mapping soil C status and identifying site-specific strategic policies to minimize the risk of land degradation and to maintain environmental sustainability. Therefore, the aim of this review is to disseminate ideas regarding current C status, identify researchable priorities and to deliberate pros and cons of agricultural management practices for better implementation of soil C sequestration strategies for mitigating the consequences of climate change. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","agricultural management practices; remote sensing and simulation models; Soil carbon sequestration","Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Carbon; Global warming; Land use; Remote sensing; Soils; Sustainable development; Agricultural management practice; Anthropogenic climate changes; Bioenergy plantation; Conservation tillage; Environmental sustainability; Integrated nutrients; Remote sensing techniques; Soil carbon sequestration; Soil conservation; agricultural management; carbon sequestration; global warming; organic farming; remote sensing; agricultural management; article; bioenergy; carbon sequestration; climate change; cropping system; environmental sustainability; human; land use; plantation; remote sensing; simulation; soil aggregation; turnover rate","English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089894162

However, ES studies at local scales that address the subject from the perspective of farm property are rare. In this paper, we performed the quantification, valuation, and mapping of carbon storage and sequestration of observed (2007–2017) and future LULC (2027) sustainable scenarios at a cattle ranch in Serra da Mantiqueira, in Southeastern Brazil. The aim was to understand how different LULC changes affect the provision of ES and contribute to economic opportunities to the farming sector. Under a GIS-approach, we used remote sensing techniques for LULC mapping, Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST) for scenario building and carbon assessment, as well as the Sis software suite for forest growth and production simulation. All scenarios contributed to increasing carbon storage and sequestration and provided profitable economic opportunities. The introduction of Eucalyptus trees in livestock and agricultural production systems is an alternative for diversification and income increase, contributing to the balance of greenhouse gases (GHG) from livestock activity and adding value to production.

In this paper, 225 soil samples were studied. The effects of different water treatments on soil organic carbon (SOC) content, and the relationship between SOC content and spectral reflectance (350–2500 nm) were studied. 17 kinds of preprocessing algorithm were performed on the original spectral (R), and the five allocation ratios of calibration to verification sets were set. Finally, the model was constructed by partial least squares regression (PLSR). The results showed that the effects of water treatment on SOC content were different in different growth stages of winter wheat. Results of correlation analysis showed that the differential transformation can refine the spectral characteristics, and improve the correlation between SOC content and spectral reflectance. Results of model construction showed that the models constructed by second-order differential transformation were not good. But the ratio of standard deviation to the standard prediction error (RPD) values of the models were constructed by simple mathematical transformation (T0–T5) and first-order differential transformation (T6–T11) can reach more than 1.4. The simple mathematical transformation (T0–T2, T4–T5) and the first-order differential transformation (T6–T10) resulted in the highest RPD in mode 5 and mode 2, respectively. Among all the models, the model of T7 in mode 2 reach the highest accuracy with a RPD value of 1.9861.

Improving food security in Africa will require a good understanding of farming systems yields as well as reducing yield gaps (i.e., the difference between potential yield and actual farmer yield). To this end, crop yield gap practices in African countries need to be understood to fill this gap while decreasing the environmental impacts of agricultural systems. For instance, the variability of yields has been demonstrated to be strongly controlled by soil fertilizer use, irrigation management, soil attribute, and the climate. Consequently, the quantitative assessment and mapping information of soil attributes such as nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), soil organic carbon (SOC), moisture content (MC), and soil texture (i.e., clay, sand and silt contents) on the ground are essential to potentially reducing the yield gap. However, to assess, measure, and monitor these soil yield-related parameters in the field, there is a need for rapid, accurate, and inexpensive methods. Recent advances in remote sensing technologies and high computational performances offer a unique opportunity to implement cost-effective spatiotemporal methods for estimating crop yield with important levels of scalability. However, researchers and scientists in Africa are not taking advantage of the opportunity of increasingly available geospatial remote sensing technologies and data for yield studies. The objectives of this report are to (i) conduct a review of scientific literature on the current status of African yield gap analysis research and their variation in regard to soil properties management by using remote sensing techniques; (ii) review and describe optimal yield practices in Africa; and (iii) identify gaps and limitations to higher yields in African smallholder farms and propose possible improvements. Our literature reviewed 80 publications and covered a period of 22 years (1998-2020) over many selected African countries with a potential yield improvement. Our results found that (i) the number of agriculture yield-focused remote sensing studies has gradually increased, with the largest proportion of studies published during the last 15 years; (ii) most studies were conducted exclusively using multispectral Landsat and Sentinel sensors; and (iii) over the past decade, hyperspectral imagery has contributed to a better understanding of yield gap analysis compared to multispectral imagery; (iv) soil nutrients (i.e., NPK) are not the main factor influencing the studied crop productivity in Africa, whereas clay, SOC, and soil pH were the most examined soil properties in prior papers. © 2021 by the authors.

The aims of this study were to explore temporal changes in cultivated land, soil erosion, and SOC loss and to identify the role of land use policy. The present study was conducted using the revised universal soil loss equation by integrating remote sensing images from 1980, 1990, 2000, and 2017. The study found that cultivated land areas increased from 275.11 thousand km2 in 1980, to 300.03 thousand km2 in 2000, and to 344.16 thousand km2 in 2010, and then decreased by 326.94 thousand km2 . The mean soil loss rates changed from 590.66 t·km−2·yr−1 in 1980 to 634.25 t·km−2·yr−1 in 2010, and then decreased to 495.66 t·km−2·yr−1 in 2017. Soil loss rate increased with increasing slope gradient. The changes in SOC loss rates demonstrated the same pattern as that of soil loss, with the largest loss rate of 728.27 kg·km−2·yr−1 . These changes can be explained by changed land use policy and population growth. In future land use management, reasonable implementation of soil conservation measures should be undertaken to reduce soil and SOC losses in the black soil region of northeastern China. © 2021 by the author.

While soil maps exist in Saskatchewan, they are at coarse scales (1:100,000), which are not always suitable for detailed soil management. One emerging technique for predictive soil mapping is the use of bare soil composite imagery derived from multi-temporal satellite imagery. This study focused on using bare soil composite imagery along with legacy soil data (1958–1998) with high location uncertainty to predict soil organic carbon, clay, and cation exchange capacity. The bare soil composite images were created from Landsat 5 imagery (1985 to 1995) using Google Earth Engine. Predictive models were built using a Random Forest model for each parameter and evaluated using a 75–25 train-test split. The soil organic carbon model had an R2 value of 0.55 with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.67 percent, with the near infrared and visible light bands being the most important features in the model. The clay predictive model has an R2 of 0.44 and a RMSE of 5.0 percent, with the shortwave infrared bands being most important. The cation exchange capacity model had an R2 of 0.50 with a RMSE of 5.7 meq 100 g−1, with the shortwave and near infrared bands as the most important predictors. Based on these results, bare soil composite imagery represents a valuable covariate for predictive soil mapping in the Canadian Prairies. This work also illustrates that for regions with extensive adoption of conservation farming practices, satellite imagery should be obtained for time periods before these practices were adopted from the months of the year where crop residues have decomposed. By combining historical soil survey data with historical imagery, maps of legacy soil properties can be generated to make comparisons against with modern data for applications such as monitoring soil organic carbon change over time. © 2021","Bare Soil Composite; Predictive Soil Mapping; Remote Sensing; Soil Organic Carbon","Agricultural wastes; Agronomy; Decision trees; Land use; Mapping; Mean square error; Organic carbon; Positive ions; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Soil conservation; Soil surveys; Soil testing; Bare soil composite; Bare soils; Cation exchange capacities; Predictive soil mapping; Remote-sensing; Root mean square errors; Soil mapping; Soil organic carbon; Soil property; Survey data; Soils","English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108639365

Agricultural water and land utilization mode has a great impact on the amount of carbon emissions, and thus the aim of this work is to propose an optimal modeling approach for generating efficient agricultural water and land management alternatives and reducing carbon emission in agricultural water-energy-food nexus system. This study presents a novel approach consisting of carbon footprint lifecycle assessment method and bi-level multi-objective stochastic programming model. The proposed approach has contributions in following aspects: (1) the environmental impact of different resource allocation strategies can be measured in optimization (2) the spatial variability of spatial data (e.g., ET0 and precipitation); can be fully reflected via remote sensing information; (3) tradeoffs among two decision-making levels and their conflicting objectives under randomness of surface water availability can be addressed. The proposed approach was applied to the middle reaches of the Heihe River basin, northwest China. After solving the proposed model, the optimal water and land use alternatives under different hydrological years can be generated. Decision makers can plan agricultural production strategy according to optimization schemes, and reduce carbon emission through increasing vegetable cultivation and surface water utilization. Furthermore, the performance comparison of different models indicated that fierce conflicts exist between income fairness and economic benefits. The comprehensive evaluation value of bi-level multi-objective stochastic programming model is 0.7036, which is highest among single- and multi-objective models, showing that such model has obvious advantage in dealing with multiple decision-making levels and conflicting objectives.

The spatial heterogeneity of farmland SOC is not only influence by the environmental factors of soil formation but also the management practices of tillage, fertilization, and irrigation. However, the traditional modeling covariates of digital soil mapping, such as terrain factors, land use types and climate factors have weak spatial variations in low-relief agricultural areas, and they cannot reflect the large spatial variation of SOC. Thus the time-series multispectral remote sensing images will be used for mapping soil properties in low relief regions in this study, meanwhile a new collaborative verification strategy was put forward to evaluate the spatial distribution characteristics of soil maps. The current study was performed in a nearly flat agricultural region southeast of Iowa (with an area of approximately 385.45 ha), where 195 surface soil samples (0–15 cm) were collected. A hyperspectral image (Headwall-Hyperspec, 380–1700 nm) and the time-series multispectral remote sensing images of Sentinel 2 and Landsat 8 were used to construct the prediction models of SOC stock and its relevant soil properties of SOC and soil bulk density (SBD) through partial least square regression (PLSR) and extreme learning machine (ELM) models. The collected soil samples and evaluation indexes of root mean square error (RMSE), R2, and ratio of performance to interquartile range (RPIQ) were used to evaluate the model performance. Results are as follows: (1) hyperspectral images were successfully used to predict the SOC stock, SOC, and SBD through PLSR and ELM, while ELM (RPIQ = 2.03, 1.97, 1.64) outperformed PLSR (RPIQ = 1.83, 1.97, 1.53); (2) the time-series multispectral remote sensing images of Sentinel 2 and Landsat 8 can reflect the spatial distribution characteristics of the SOC stock, SOC and SBD by PLSR and ELM, but the combination of Sentinel 2 images and ELM obtained the best prediction results (RPIQ = 1.45, 1.25, 1.26); and (3) the differences of the soil maps predicted by the hyperspectral image and time-series multispectral remote sensing images were small, and the largest percentage errors nearly appeared on the edges of the farmland patches owing to mixed pixels. This study further confirmed the good prediction abilities of the time-series multispectral remote sensing images in low relief farmland regions. Lastly, this mapping strategy can provide additional valuable information for agricultural management and carbon cycle. © 2021","Airborne hyperspectral imaging; Collaborative verification; Digital soil mapping; Spatial distribution patterns; Time-series multispectral remote sensing images","Agriculture; Forecasting; Hyperspectral imaging; Land use; Learning systems; Mean square error; Remote sensing; Soil surveys; Soils; Spatial distribution; Spectroscopy; Time series; Airborne hyperspectral imaging; Collaborative verification; Digital soil mappings; Learning machines; Multispectral remote sensing image; Soil organic carbon; Soil organic Carbon stocks; Spatial distribution patterns; Time-series multispectral remote sensing image; Times series; Organic carbon; agricultural land; agricultural soil; carbon sequestration; mapping method; organic carbon; remote sensing; satellite imagery; soil carbon; soil property; time series analysis; Matthiola","English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103790499

Contemporary Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) carrying low-cost and lightweight multispectral sensors provide high spatial resolution imagery (<10 cm). These capabilities allow integrate of UAS-derived soil data and maps into digitalized workflows for sustainable agriculture. However, the common situation of scarce soil data at field scale might be an obstacle for accurate digital soil mapping. In our case study we tested a fixed-wing UAS equipped with visible and near infrared (VIS-NIR) sensors to estimate topsoil SOC distribution at two fields under the constraint of limited sampling points, which were selected by pedological knowledge. They represent all releva nt soil types along an erosion-deposition gradient; hence, the full feature space in terms of topsoils’ SOC status. We included the Topographic Position Index (TPI) as a co-variate for SOC prediction. Our study was performed in a soil landscape of hummocky ground moraines, which represent a significant of global arable land. Herein, small scale soil variability is mainly driven by tillage erosion which, in turn, is strongly dependent on topography. Relationships between SOC, TPI and spectral information were tested by Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) using: (i) single field data (local approach) and (ii) data from both fields (pooled approach). The highest prediction performance determined by a leave-one-out-cross-validation (LOOCV) was obtained for the models using the reflectance at 570 nm in conjunction with the TPI as explanatory variables for the local approach (coefficient of determination (R²) = 0.91; root mean square error (RMSE) = 0.11% and R² = 0.48; RMSE = 0.33, respectively). The local MLR models developed with both reflectance and TPI using values from all points showed high correlations and low prediction errors for SOC content (R² = 0.88, RMSE = 0.07%; R² = 0.79, RMSE = 0.06%, respectively). The comparison with an enlarged dataset consisting of all points from both fields (pooled approach) showed no improvement of the prediction accuracy but yielded decreased prediction errors. Lastly, the local MLR models were applied to the data of the respective other field to evaluate the cross-field prediction ability. The spatial SOC pattern generally remains unaffected on both fields; differences, however, occur concerning the predicted SOC level. Our results indicate a high potential of the combination of UAS-based remote sensing and environmental covariates, such as terrain attributes, for the prediction of topsoil SOC content at the field scale. The temporal flexibility of UAS offer the opportunity to optimize flight conditions including weather and soil surface status (plant cover or residuals, moisture and roughness) which, otherwise, might obscure the relationship between spectral data and SOC content.

However, large datasets needed to accurately assess SOC at high resolution across scales are labor-intensive, time-consuming, and expensive. Ancillary geodata, including remote sensing spectral indices (RS-SIs) and topographic indicators (TIs), have been proposed as spatial covariates. Reported relationships between SOC and RS-SIs are erratic, possibly because single-date RS-SIs do not accurately capture SOC spatial variability due to transient confounding factors in the soil (e.g., moisture). However, multitemporal RS-SI data analysis may lead to noise reduction in SOC versus RS-SI relationships. This study aimed at: i) comparing single-date versus multitemporal RS-Sis derived from Sentinel-2 imagery for assessment of topsoil (0–0.2 m) SOC in two agricultural fields located in south-eastern Brazil; ii) comparing the performance of RS-SIs and TIs; iii) using adequate RS-SIs and TIs to compare sampling schemes defined on different collection grids; and iv) studying the temporal changes of SOC (0–0.2 m and 0.2–0.4 m). Results showed that: i) single-date RS-SIs were not reliable proxies for topsoil SOC at the study sites. For most of the tested RS-SIs, multitemporal data analysis produced accurate proxies for SOC; e.g., for the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, the 4.5th multitemporal percentile predicted SOC with an R2 of 0.64; ii) The best TI was elevation (ranging from 643 to 684 m) with an R2 of 0.70; iii) The multitemporal SI and elevation maps indicated that the different sampling schemes were equally representative of the topsoil SOC's distribution across the entire area; and iv) From 2012 through 2019, topsoil SOC increased from 19.3 to 24.1 g kg−1. The ratio between SOC in the topsoil and subsoil (0.2–0.4 m) decreased from 1.7 to 1.1. Further testing of the proposed multitemporal RS-SI analysis is necessary to confirm its dependability for SOC assessment in Brazil and elsewhere. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Crop rotation; Reduced tillage; Remote sensing; Sentinel-2; Spectral indices; Sustainable agriculture","Data handling; Large dataset; Noise abatement; Organic carbon; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Soils; Crop rotation; Multi-temporal; Multi-temporal remote sensing; Reduced tillage; Remote-sensing; Sentinel-2; Soil organic carbon; Spectral indices; Sustainable agriculture; Topsoil; Agriculture; organic carbon; agricultural soil; alternative agriculture; crop rotation; farm; image analysis; organic carbon; remote sensing; satellite imagery; Sentinel; soil carbon; soil organic matter; tillage; accuracy; agricultural land; Article; Brazil; data analysis; data processing; image analysis; irrigation (agriculture); prediction; remote sensing; satellite imagery; soil chemistry; time series analysis; Brazil","English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105695483

As the cropland expansion took place in Brazil the last decades, leading to significant land-use change and environmental impacts, detailed information about soils is fundamental for sustainable development. Thus, considering the lack of spatially explicit information about cropland soils in Brazil, we aimed at performing high-resolution mapping of key topsoil attributes using spectral and terrain features extracted from Earth observation data (EOD). With the resulting information, we also aimed at performing a general examination of the main agricultural regions and estimate the total organic carbon stocks on croplands soils. For this, we obtained environmental predictors from the historical collection of Landsat data and the digital elevation model from Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission at the cloud-based platform of Google Earth Engine. The environmental predictors (30 m spatial resolution) with georeferenced soil samples (n = 5097) were used for predicting the topsoil content (0–20 cm) of clay, sand, silt, cation exchange capacity, pH, soil organic carbon (SOC) and SOC stock. Prediction models of clay, sand, SOC content, and SOC stocks had the best performance metrics, achieving a R2 ranging from 0.44 to 0.74 and ratio of performance to the interquartile range higher than 1.5. The predicted maps revealed the variability of topsoil among the cropped areas, indicating that the agricultural expansion took place on sandy soils. The SOC stock map provided consistent estimates compared to previous datasets but revealed additional information at the local and regional scales. Thus, this study supports the proposition that EOD is a valuable source for extracting environmental features for mapping and monitoring cropland soils at finer resolutions, assisting the evaluation of soil spatial distribution and the historical agriculture expansion over large geographical areas. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Bare soil composite; Croplands; Digital soil mapping; Google Earth engine; Machine learning; Remote sensing","Agriculture; Engines; Environmental impact; Expansion; Land use; Learning systems; Observatories; Organic carbon; Remote sensing; Soil surveys; Sustainable development; Bare soil composite; Cropland; Digital soil mappings; Earth observation data; Google earth engine; Machine-learning; Remote-sensing; Soil organic Carbon stocks; Spatial variability; Topsoil; Soils; cation exchange capacity; data set; digital elevation model; Landsat; performance assessment; satellite data; spatial distribution; World Wide Web; Brazil; Matthiola","English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103099010

Scientists and policy analysts increasingly seek to develop programs and policies which recognize the importance of mitigation of climate change and insurance of ecological sustainability when managing agricultural soils. In response, many countries are exploring options to develop local land-use carbon inventories to better understand the flow of carbon in agriculture to estimate its contribution to greenhouse gas (GHG) reporting. For instance, the Canadian province of Ontario does not currently have its own GHG inventory and relies on the Canada’s National Inventory Report (NIR). To address this, the province explored options to develop its own land-use carbon inventory to better understand the carbon resource in agricultural soils. As part of this undertaking, a gap analysis was conducted to identify the critical information gaps and limitations in estimating soil organic carbon (SOC) monitoring to develop a land-use carbon inventory (LUCI) for the cropland sector in Ontario. We conducted a review of analytical and modeling methods used to quantify GHG emissions and reporting for the cropland sectors in Canada, and compared them with the methods used in seven other countries (i.e., France, United Kingdom; Germany; United States of America, Australia, New Zealand, and Japan). From this comparison, four target areas of research were identified to consider in the development of a cropland sector LUCI in Ontario. First, there needs to be a refinement of the modelling approach used for SOC accounting. The Century model, which is used for Ontario’s cropland sector, can benefit from updates to the crop growth model and from the inclusion of manure management and other amendments. Secondly, a raster-based spatially explicit modelling approach is recommended as an alternative to using polygon-based inputs for soil data and census information for land management. This approach can leverage readily available Earth Observation (EO) data (e.g., remote sensing maps, digital soil maps). Thirdly, the contributions from soil erosion need to be included in inventory estimates of SOC emissions and removals from cropland. Fourth, establishment of an extensive network of long-term experimental sites to calibrate and validate the SOC models (i.e., CENTURY) is required. This can be done by putting in place a ground-truth program, through farmer-led research initiatives and collaboration, to deal with uncertainties due to spatial variability and regional climates. This approach would provide opportunities for farmers to collaborate on data collection by keeping detailed records of their cropping and soil management practices, and crop yields. © 2021 by the authors.

At regional and global scales, digital mapping of SOC has been successful using environmental variables such as climatic, land use and terrain factors. However, such a mapping for agricultural lands in low-relief areas cannot be resolved due to weak spatial variations of the environmental variables. An alternative approach, based on time series of remote sensing images, has recently been emphasized in estimating SOC since crop growth status clearly revealed by satellite images is strongly related to SOC. However, there is still a lack of full understanding of impacts of factors such as data source, regression techniques, and spatial resolution on the accuracy of SOC mapping using time series of satellite images. In this study, prediction variables including four spectral bands (i.e., blue, green, red, and near-infrared bands) and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) from Sentinel 2, Gaofen (GF) 1, and Landsat 8 data, acquired between November 2017 to March 2018, were individually used to estimate SOC by stepwise regression (STR), partial least squares regression (PLSR), and extreme learning machine (ELM). Besides, we further explored the influence of satellite parameters, such as scanning time, spectral bands and vegetation indices on predicting SOC using Sentinel 2 time series images. Results showed that: (1) the time series of remote sensing images can be used to map SOC in small- and large-extent low-relief areas with low evaluated root mean square errors (0.199 % and 0.249 %) and high R2 (0.555 and 0.528), (2) SOC estimations from the Sentinel-2 time series images, compared to those from Landsat 8 and GF 1 datasets, exhibited a better accuracy, and the ELM yielded a better prediction accuracy than PLSR and STR, (3) the satellite parameters of the spatial resolution, the acquisition time and the spectral bands significantly affected the prediction accuracy. This study offers more comprehensive information than terrain factors for revealing the influence of satellite parameters on predicting SOC, and provides great help for constructing one more suitable and higher precision soil mapping strategy for agricultural lands in low-relief areas. © 2021","Digital soil mapping; Soil organic carbon mapping; Time series remote sensing","Agriculture; Forecasting; Image resolution; Infrared devices; Land use; Learning systems; Least squares approximations; Mean square error; Organic carbon; Photomapping; Regression analysis; Remote sensing; Satellites; Soil surveys; Soils; Vegetation; Agricultural land; Digital soil mappings; Environmental variables; Satellite parameters; Soil organic carbon; Soil organic carbon mapping; Spectral band; Terrain factors; Time series remote sensing; Times series; Time series; agricultural land; digital mapping; environmental factor; Landsat; machine learning; remote sensing; satellite data; Sentinel; soil organic matter; spatial resolution; spatial variation; time series analysis","English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103308699

While the status and trends of national forest monitoring capacities have been previously assessed for the tropics, this has not been systematically done worldwide. In this paper, we assess the use and quality of forest monitoring data sources for national reporting to the FRA in 236 countries and territories. More specifically, we (a) analyze the use of remote sensing (RS) for forest area monitoring and the use of national forest inventory (NFI) for monitoring forest area, growing stock, biomass, carbon stock, and other attributes in FRA 2005-2020, (b) assess data quality in FRA 2020 using FAO tier-based indicators, and (c) zoom in to investigate changes in tropical forest monitoring capacities in FRA 2010-2020. Globally, the number of countries monitoring forest area using RS at good to very good capacities increased from 55 in FRA 2005 to 99 in FRA 2020. Likewise, the number of countries with good to very good NFI capacities increased from 48 in FRA 2005 to 102 in FRA 2020. This corresponds to ∼85% of the global forest area monitored with one or more nationally-produced up-to-date RS products or NFI in FRA 2020. For large proportions of global forests, the highest quality data was used in FRA 2020 for reporting on forest area (93%), growing stock (85%), biomass (76%), and carbon pools (61%). Overall, capacity improvements are more widespread in the tropics, which can be linked to continued international investments for forest monitoring especially in the context of reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation in tropical countries (REDD+). More than 50% of the tropical countries with targeted international support improved both RS and NFI capacities in the period 2010-2020 on top of those that already had persistent good to very good capabilities. There is also a link between improvements in national capacities and improved governance measured against worldwide governance indicators (WGI).

Since variability of SOC is mainly attributed to biophysical land surface variables, integrating a compressive set of such indices may support the pursuit of an optimum set of predictor variables. Therefore, this study was aimed at predicting the spatial distribution of SOC in relation to remotely sensed variables and other covariates. Hence, the land surface variables were combined from remote sensing, topographic, and soil spectral sources. Moreover, the most influential variables for prediction were selected using the random forest (RF) and classification and regression tree (CART). The results indicated that the RF model has good prediction performance with corresponding R2 and root-mean-square error (RMSE) values of 0.96 and 0.91 mg·g−1, respectively. The distribution of SOC content showed variability across landforms (CV = 78.67%), land use (CV = 93%), and lithology (CV = 64.67%). Forestland had the highest SOC (13.60 mg·g−1) followed by agriculture (10.43 mg·g−1), urban (9.74 mg·g−1), and water body (4.55 mg·g−1) land uses. Furthermore, soils developed in bauxite and laterite lithology had the highest SOC content (14.69 mg·g−1). The SOC content was remarkably lower in soils developed in sandstones; however, the values obtained in soils from the rest of the lithologies could not be significantly differentiated. The mean SOC concentration was 11.70 mg·g−1, where the majority of soils in the study area were classified as highly humus and extremely humus. The soils with the highest SOC content (extremely humus) were distributed in the mountainous regions of the study area. The biophysical land surface indices, brightness removed vegetation indices, topographic indices, and soil spectral bands were the most influential predictors of SOC in the study area. The spatial variability of SOC may be influenced by landform, land use, and lithology of the study area. Remotely sensed predictors including land moisture, land surface temperature, and built-up indices added valuable information for the prediction of SOC. Hence, the land surface indices may provide new insights into SOC modeling in complex landscapes of warm subtropical urban regions. © 2021 by the authors.

Large-scale, high-resolution, and accurately quantified ET and GPP values are important fundamental data for freshwater resource management and help in understanding terrestrial carbon and water cycles in an arid region. In this study, the revised surface energy balance system (SEBS) model and MOD17 GPP algorithm were used to estimate daily ET and GPP at 100 m resolution based on multi-source satellite remote sensing data to obtain surface biophysical parameters and meteorological forcing data as input variables for the model in the midstream oasis area of the Heihe River Basin (HRB) from 2010 to 2016. Then, we further calculated the ecosystem water-use efficiency (WUE). We validated the daily ET, GPP, and WUE from ground observations at a crop oasis station and conducted spatial intercomparisons of monthly and annual ET, GPP, and WUE at the irrigation district and cropland oasis scales. The site-level evaluation results show that ET and GPP had better performance than WUE at the daily time scale. Specifically, the deviations in the daily ET, GPP, and WUE data compared with ground observations were small, with a root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute percent error (MAPE) of 0.75 mm/day and 26.59%, 1.13 gC/m2 and 36.26%, and 0.50 gC/kgH2O and 39.83%, respectively. The regional annual ET, GPP, and WUE varied from 300 to 700 mm, 200 to 650 gC/m2, and 0.5 to 1.0 gC/kgH2O, respectively, over the entire irrigation oasis area. It was found that annual ET and GPP were greater than 550 mm and 500 gC/m2, and annual oasis cropland WUE had strong invariability and was maintained at approximately 0.85 gC/kgH2O. The spatial intercomparisons from 2010 to 2016 revealed that ET had similar spatial patterns to GPP due to tightly coupled carbon and water fluxes. However, the WUE spatiotemporal patterns were slightly different from both ET and GPP, particularly in the early and late growing seasons for the oasis area. Our results demonstrate that spatial full coverage and reasonably fine spatiotemporal variation and variability could significantly improve our understanding of water-saving irrigation strategies and oasis agricultural water management practices in the face of water shortage issues. © 2021 by the authors.

However, they are not well protected and are consequently being replaced by agricultural systems worldwide. Current monitoring efforts using remote sensing and ground-based methods are insufficient, and accordingly the mapping of grassland to cropland conversions must be improved to better document these changes in the Canadian Prairies. The purpose of this study is to evaluate different structural break methods and remote sensing datasets for their temporal accuracy in detecting grassland conversions in two Alberta study areas from 2010 to 2018. Breaks For Additive Seasonal and Trend (BFAST), BFAST Seasonal and Bayesian Estimator of Abrupt change, Seasonality and Trend (BEAST) methods were applied to evaluate their sensitivity to rangeland and pasture conversions. The best model was BFAST Seasonal, correctly predicting the year of change for 76% of rangelands and 66% of pastures. This demonstrates that seasonal models are effective in detecting interannual changes in vegetation composition amidst background noise from climate and management induced phenological changes. MODIS data outperformed Landsat, outlining the importance of high temporal resolution remote sensing data to successful change detection, even at the expense of higher spatial resolution. Overall, this study demonstrates that structural break methods are effective in identifying grassland to agriculture transitions and may be useful for the operational monitoring of grassland inventories in the future. © 2021","Agriculture; Breakpoints; Grasslands; Land cover change; Landsat; MODIS; Multitemporal image analysis; Soil carbon; Vegetation dynamics","Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Climate models; Remote sensing; Agricultural system; Bayesian estimators; High temporal resolution; Multitemporal image analysis; Operational monitoring; Phenological changes; Remote sensing data; Vegetation composition; Climate change; Alberta","English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099512440

Remote sensing data (e.g., gross primary productivity, GPP; evapotranspiration, ET; and the normalized difference vegetation index, NDVI) were used to investigate the spatiotemporal characteristics of WUEc in the Loess Plateau during three periods: 1982–2015, 1982–2001, and 2001–2015. The results indicated that, first, the average and the trend of WUEc showed strong spatial heterogeneity over 1982–2015, a period that shows a strip distribution. The average value increased from the northwest to the southeast while the multiyear trend value decreased from the northwest to the southeast, and a positive slope prevailed (p &lt; 0.05). Second, statistically significant positive trends (p &lt; 0.001) in the annual mean WUEc for 1982–2015, with a value of 7.11 × 10−3 g C kg−1 H2O yr−1, indicate that the rate of carbon sequestration in the agricultural ecosystem was faster than that of water loss. Finally, the GGP was conducive to the improvement of WUEc in this arid and semiarid area, with interannual trend values of WUEc from 1982 to 2001 of 4.26 × 10−3 g C kg−1 H2O, and 9.88 × 10−3 g C kg−1 H2O (p &lt; 0.05) after the GGP. Our analyses explored how the changes in WUEc after the GGP were more sensitive to the NDVIc (the subscript c stands for cropland) trends, which means that NDVIc was an important controller influencing GPPc and ETc tendency and thus further influencing WUEc in response to the GGP.

In this study, we combined AGB field survey data and remote sensing data to build a suitable model to estimate the grassland AGB in the Three-River Source Region (TRSR) of China. Three machine learning models were used to simulate the grassland AGB from 2001 to 2019, including support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and high accuracy surface modeling (HASM). The results show that (1) the HASM achieved better results than the RF and SVM models (R2 = 0.8459 &gt; 0.72 &gt; 0.5858; RMSE = 29 &lt; 41 &lt; 56), and the HASM results reproduce the spatial distribution characteristics of the biomass well. The subsequent spatiotemporal analysis of the AGB conducted in this study was based on the results of the HASM. (2) The highest AGB was located in the eastern and central-southern parts of the TRSR, and the lowest AGB was distributed in the western region. (3) The overall change in the AGB revealed that the percentage of the area that experienced a significant increase in AGB (21%) was larger than that of the area that experienced a significant decrease (13%), and the stable areas accounted for 66% of the total area. The grassland AGB increased by 1 g/m2/yr during 2001–2019. (4) The factors driving the changes in the AGB were analyzed. Overall, the warm and wet climate conditions promoted grass growth in most regions of the TRSR. (5) However, the biomass decreased in some regions with warm and wet conditions. For example, overgrazing and increased populations of grazing led to significant biomass decreases in the towns of Ziketang and Heka in Xinghai County. In this study, the grassland AGB was simulated based on the HASM model, with a high accuracy and a spatial resolution of 500 m.

Farmland area has been reported to increase despite agriculture's vulnerability to climate variations. This great interplay among land-use dynamics, climate extremes, and food systems is, however, understudied. The current research, therefore, explores this interaction at both national and regional scales for the period between 2001 and 2017. Following an approach that employs remote sensing datasets on Net Primary Productivity (NPP), land cover types, drought indices, and climate variables, i.e. precipitation, temperature, and evapotranspiration, impacts of climate extremes and land cover changes on food production have been analysed. Similarly, the performance of ten major crops in Uganda over the last 6 decades has been detected using the Regime Shift technique. Key findings, thereof, indicate that NPP in farmlands is sensitive to climate variability, and this sensitivity varies spatially among the regions. Forests and permanent wetlands have been massively changed into farmlands, hence, moving a step forward into offsetting food insecurity but a step backward in preserving ecosystem services, espcially mitigating climate change. Furthermore, the noticeable increase in the total production of the major crops in Uganda seems to be derived mainly by the increase in area harvested affirming the step towards food security. However, the influences, thereof, may aggravate climate change impacts especially through reversing carbon sinks into carbon sources. This reversal could impact the crop yields further. Contrastingly, results from some crops illustrate the potential to increase crop production without necessarily expanding the cropland area. Therefore, Uganda may, instead, consider exploiting the maximum yield potential of crops through, for instance, augmenting rainfed agriculture with irrigation and enforcing effective policies rather than expanding farmland area. These findings collectively contribute further to our understanding of the importance of policies that ensure food security but at the same time preserve a healthy environment. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Climate extremes; Food systems; Land cover/use dynamics; Uganda","Agricultural robots; Carbon; Crops; Cultivation; Ecosystems; Farms; Food supply; Irrigation; Land use; Remote sensing; Climate change impact; Climate variability; Climate variables; Ecosystem services; Healthy environments; Land use dynamics; Net primary productivity; Rain fed agriculture; Climate change; climate change; crop production; data set; extreme event; food security; food supply; land cover; land use change; remote sensing; spatial analysis; article; carbon sink; carbon source; climate change; crop production; cropland; drought; evapotranspiration; food industry; food insecurity; food security; forest; harvest; precipitation; productivity; remote sensing; Uganda; wetland; Uganda","English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092670434

Yet these essential land resources are often overlooked and threatened by human activities. Such changes lead to an unbalanced state of soil functions. The land degradation neutrality (LDN) concept has been developed to serve the sustainable development goals (SDGs), in particular goal No.15. Our goal was to move an idea from LDN concept to reality. We assessed the LDN status of the agricultural area in Saraburi Province, Thailand by using three indicators: (i) land use/land cover (LULC) change, (ii) land productivity (LP) change, and (iii) soil organic carbon (SOC) change. The indicator datasets recorded in 2017 and 2020 were used to investigate the land resource changes. LULC and NDVI metrics were obtained using Landsat 8 satellite images and areas were classified into agricultural and non-agricultural uses. For the SOC stocks, 78 agricultural soil samples were collected from the top 30cm by the Land Development Regional Office 1 (Pathum Thani) in 2017 and by the research team in 2020. The standard procedure used for the SOC laboratory analysis was the Walkley–Black method. The LDN status was estimated by integration of results of the three indicators based on a ""one out, all out"" system. Over three years, the study metrics indicated that net loss occurred in LULC covering the area of 46.99 km2 and SOC stocks declined at an average of 0.02%. However, the NDVI obtained from the estimate did not show a difference in the three-year period. This research highlighted alarming signs of soil degradation in the agricultural economics zone. Negative changes occurred in two of the three indicators which showed a tendency towards the degradation of soil capital in the long run. Counterbalancing measures to achieve equivalent losses and gains should be implemented as quickly as possible. © 2021 Institute of Physics Publishing.

They represent a critical carbon (C) reservoir and provide forage and fodder to millions of livestock. Quantifying how management and climate affect grassland C dynamics is key to achieving climate-resilient farming, to shaping and monitoring data-informed policies, and to transitioning to a zero-C agri-food sector. To this end, remote sensing systems provide information on grassland vegetation in near-real time, across large domains and at high resolution. Biogeochemical models use our continuously-developing knowledge on ecosystem functioning to describe ecosystem C dynamics and the effects of weather and human management on them. Field measurements of C pools and fluxes provide direct ground observations of grassland C losses and gains. The combination of earth and ground observations with modelling represents a robust way for quantifying, monitoring and verifying grassland ecosystem C stocks. This presentation demonstrates our current capabilities in regards to this. We have developed and tested a model-data fusion (MDF) framework that uses earth observation data (Proba-V and Sentinel-2) on vegetation canopy (leaf area index) to infer vegetation management (grazing, cutting) and inform a validated process-based model of field-scale C dynamics (DALEC-Grass). The framework was applied for 2017-2018 at 1855 grassland fields that were sampled from across the UK. The MDF-predicted livestock density per area and the corresponding agricultural census-based data had a correlation coefficient (r) of 0.68. The MDF-predicted annual yield (harvested and cut biomass) was within the range of relevant measured data and reflected the variation of grassland management intensity across the UK. On average, the simulated grasslands were C sinks in 2017 and 2018 but the 2018 European summer heatwave resulted in a 9-fold increase in the number of simulated fields that were C sources in 2018 compared to 2017. We argue that earth observation data can be used in a MDF framework to monitor grassland vegetation management and to simulate its impacts on the C balance of any UK grassland field as well as to attribute changes in annual C balance to human activities and weather anomalies. © 2021 SPIE.","Biogeochemical modelling; Carbon; Grasslands; Leaf area index; Remote sensing; UK","Agriculture; Biogeochemistry; Data fusion; Dynamics; Ecosystems; Monitoring; Observatories; Real time systems; Remote sensing; Vegetation; Biogeochemical modelling; Field scale; Grassland; Grassland vegetation; Ground observations; Leaf Area Index; Model-data fusions; Near-real time; Remote-sensing; United kingdom; Carbon","English",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85120442915

Classified images covering different time periods showed that the largest land uses among the different land uses in the selected watersheds are built-up and agriculture. Much of the carbon stock was attributed to the high carbon pool values of the forest class. The reduction of forest areas in the watersheds resulted in a decrease in the total carbon stock.

The “4 per 1000” (4p1000) initiative, launched during the COP 21 in Paris in 2015, based on translating the science of soil carbon sequestration into action at the global scale, is one example of a broader set of negative emission technologies (NETs). While governments and non-governmental organizations are voluntarily implementing the aspirational 4p1000, its adoption and pledges by industry or the private sector is the driving force to accelerate the process of re-carbonization of soil and the terrestrial biosphere. The pledge of achieving carbon (C) neutrality by 2030 or 2050 by some prominent industries is encouraging, and it can serve as a role model for other industries to follow. Adoption of the 4p1000 concept by agro-industries (e.g., fertilizers, pesticides, farm machinery, irrigation, food processing) can promote and accelerate adoption of recommended management practices which create a positive/soil ecosystem carbon budget and enhance C sequestration. This review article describes examples of the emission-neutral concept already adopted by some industries, outlines strategies to promote 4p1000 and NETs, and discusses approaches to advance site-specific NETs. These techniques may include conservation agriculture, cover cropping, precision agriculture, etc., facilitated by artificial intelligence, remote sensing, and robots. Innovative methods of soil sampling as well as remote sensing and mapping of SOC stock are pertinent to promoting NETs and 4p1000. Payments to land managers and farmers for provisioning of ecosystem services through C sequestration in soil and the biosphere can advance the mission of 4p1000. Amongst strategies of encouraging industries to adopt NETs, implementation of a “Healthy Soil Act” at the state, national, and global level could be a step in the right direction. Market-based economic incentives to industry may be another option to promote adoption of NETs. Similar to U.S. EPA Clean Air Act of 1963 and the U.S. EPA Clean Water Act of 1972, there is a strong need to enact a Healthy Soil Act globally. An effective implementation of the trinity of Acts (air, water, and soil) at the national and global scale will accelerate the process of re-carbonization of the soil and the terrestrial biosphere while also strengthening the provisioning of essential ecosystem services. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Artificial intelligence; Climate change; Ecosystem services; Global warming; Negative emission technologies; Societal value of soil carbon; Soil carbon sequestration; Soil health","Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Artificial intelligence; Biospherics; Budget control; Carbon; Carbonization; Chemical contamination; Ecosystems; Food processing; Intelligent robots; Laws and legislation; Machinery; Remote sensing; Conservation agricultures; Economic incentive; Ecosystem services; Emission technology; Management practices; Nongovernmental organizations; Soil carbon sequestration; Terrestrial biosphere; Soils; carbon budget; carbon sequestration; emission control; government; industrial technology; nongovernmental organization; pollution policy; private sector; soil carbon; soil science; France; Ile de France; Paris; Ville de Paris","English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088820034

Within this region, Western Bahia stands out as a large producer of soy and cotton. There are no studies that quantify carbon stocks for different land uses and land cover types in Western Bahia, which hinders comprehension of the role of agricultural expansion in carbon dynamics and the development of sustainable agriculture policies. Here, we evaluate how the land use changes in this region have affected the carbon balance in the aboveground biomass (AGB), belowground biomass (BGB), and soil reservoirs. We collected soil samples for areas with different land uses and land cover types to estimate soil carbon stocks (SCS) and combined remote sensing results and modeling techniques to develop a historical reconstruction of spatial patterns of SCS, AGB, and BGB during the period 1990-2018. The replacement of areas from the forest formations class with pasture and rainfed agriculture reduced the 100 cm depth SCS (SCS100) by 37.3% (p = 0.031) and 30.3% (p = 0.053), respectively. By contrast, the conversion of pasture and rainfed agriculture to irrigated agriculture increased SCS100 by 34% (p = 0.034) and 26.5% (p = 0.022), respectively. Spatial changes in historical carbon stocks are strongly associated with land use changes that occurred between 1990 and 2018. We estimated a non-significant loss of 61.9 Tg-C (p = 0.726) from the total carbon stocks (calculated as the sum of AGB, BGB, and SCS) of which 80% of the losses came from soil stocks, 11% from BGB, and 8% from AGB. These findings reveal the need to monitor carbon stocks in sandy soils to reduce the uncertainties of estimates and support the development of effective sustainable agriculture policies. The best alternatives for reducing carbon losses in the Cerrado are to maintain natural forest cover and to recover soils through sustainable soil management, especially in pasturelands where soil carbon stocks are lowest. © 2020 Dionizio et al.

We present the results of an automated system used across 645 counties in the United States Corn Belt from 2005 to 2018, mapped at field-scale and summarized for distribution at aggregated scales. Large-scale mapping by OpTIS (Operational Tillage Information System), a software tool that analyzes remotely sensed data of agricultural land, provides trends of conservation tillage (defined as >30% residue cover), cover cropping, and crop rotations, while modeling by DNDC (Denitrification–Decomposition), a process-based model of carbon and biogeochemistry in soil, provides estimates of the ecosystem outcomes associated with the changes in management practices mapped by OpTIS. Ground-truthing data acquired via OpTIS mobile, a roadside field-surveying app, were used for verification in 30 counties. OpTIS results for the Corn Belt show adoption of cover crops after planting corn and soy increased from 1% to 3% of the mapped area when comparing 2006 to 2018. Comparison of trends for conservation tillage use from 2006 to 2018 shows a slight decrease in conservation tillage adoption, from 46% to 44%. Results from DNDC show these soils sequestered soil organic carbon (SOC) at an area-weighted mean change in SOC (dSOC) rate of 161 kgC/ha/year. Comparatively, in a scenario modeled without the adoption of soil health management practices, the same soils would have lost SOC at an area-weighted rate of −65 kgC/ha/year. As many factors affect changes to SOC, including climate and initial SOC in soils, modeling counterfactual scenarios at the field scale demonstrates outcomes of current soil health management in comparison to regional management practices and best management practices, with respect to SOC sequestration. Regional trends in adoption rates of conservation agriculture and resulting soil health implications are of great use for a wide range of stakeholders. We demonstrate the capability of OpTIS remote sensing to deliver robust, large-scale, multi-sensor, ground-verified monitoring data of current and historical adoption of conservation practices, and of DNDC process-based modeling to provide assessments of the associated environmental outcomes across regions in U.S. cropland. © 2020 by the authors.

The latter provides ecosystem services (ES), of which carbon sequestration is one. Estimation of aboveground carbon stocks in NPPV has incentivized carbon storage within the agricultural landscape. Remote sensing has significantly improved resolution of earth imaging and automated assessment of these often small, fragmented NPPV parcels. Novel methods of assessment have also been motivated by changes in land policy and concomitant loss of NPPV carbon stocks. To characterize and evaluate the carbon storage potential of agricultural NPPV in Southwestern British Columbia, we utilized a compliment of remote sensing and secondary data sources. Object- and pixel-oriented classification with RapidEye imagery enabled mapping of NPPV at 92.9% accuracy, covering 33.2% of the landscape. NPPV provided 3.34 Mt C in aboveground biomass, 38.4% of which was composed of fragments unlikely to be identified through coarser satellite imagery. Using secondary soil surveys and sub-regional characteristics, indicators of agricultural expansion suggested that small parcels of NPPV were more likely to persist on active farmland, while large forest stands (' 9 hectares) were less likely to occur alongside lands already in production and often located on lands amenable to farming. Were these large contiguous tracks of NPPV cleared for production agriculture, we estimate that 0.98–1.86 Mt of stored carbon could potentially be released. These stands represent important carbon sinks and their retention could be incentivized through ES services remuneration and conservation programs. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Agriculture; Carbon stocks; Ecosystem services; Land cover; Remote sensing","aboveground biomass; automation; carbon sequestration; carbon sink; conservation management; ecosystem service; perennial plant; remote sensing; satellite imagery; stand structure; temperate environment; vegetation cover; British Columbia; Canada","English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087077555

Despite its importance, the current understanding of the magnitude or even the direction of SOC change in agricultural landscapes is limited. While changes in land use/land cover (LULC) and climate are among the main drivers of changes in SOC, their relative importance for the spatiotemporal assessment of SOC is unclear. This study evaluated LULC and SOC dynamics using archived and recent soil samples, remote sensing, and digital soil mapping in the Lower Fraser Valley of British Columbia, Canada. We combined both pixel- and object-based analysis of Landsat satellite imagery to assess LULC changes from 1984 to 2018. We achieved an overall accuracy of 81% and kappa coefficient of 0.77 for LULC classification using a random forest model. For predicting SOC for the same time period, we applied soil and vegetation indices derived from Landsat images, topographic indices, historic soil survey variables, and climate data in a random forest model. The SOC prediction of 2018 resulted in a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.67, concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) of 0.76, and normalized root mean square error (nRMSE) of 0.12. For 1984, the SOC prediction accuracies were 0.46, 0.58, and 0.18 for R2, CCC, and nRMSE, respectively. We detected SOC loss in 61%, gain in 12%, while 27% remained unchanged across the study area. Although we detected large losses of SOC due to LULC change, the majority of the SOC losses across the landscape were attributed to areas that were remained in the same type of agricultural production since 1984. Climate variability did not, however, have a strong effect on SOC changes. These results can inform decision making in the study area to support sustainable LULC management for enhancing SOC sequestration. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Digital soil mapping; Landsat; Object-based classification; Random forest; Remote sensing","Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Climate models; Decision making; Decision trees; Forecasting; Land use; Mean square error; Organic carbon; Random forests; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Soil surveys; Soils; Agricultural landscapes; Agricultural productions; British Columbia , Canada; Correlation coefficient; Digital soil mappings; Object-based analysis; Random forest modeling; Root mean square errors; Climate change; organic carbon; soil organic carbon; soil organic matter; unclassified drug; accuracy assessment; agricultural land; heterogeneity; land cover; land use change; Landsat; organic carbon; prediction; satellite imagery; soil carbon; soil organic matter; agricultural land; Article; Canada; climate; controlled study; land use; landscape; measurement accuracy; nonhuman; prediction; priority journal; random forest; remote sensing; satellite imagery; soil change; vegetation; British Columbia; Canada; Fraser Valley","English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084647300

We present a simplified framework for developing a high spatial resolution map of urban vegetation cover in the Southern California Air Basin (SoCAB) with publicly available satellite imagery. This method uses Sentinel-2 (10-60 × 10-60 m) and National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) (0.6 × 0.6 m) optical imagery to classify urban and non-urban areas of impervious surface, tree, grass, shrub, bare soil/non-photosynthetic vegetation, and water. Our approach was designed for Los Angeles, a geographically complex megacity characterized by diverse Mediterranean land cover and a mix of high-rise buildings and topographic features that produce strong shadow effects. We show that a combined NAIP and Sentinel-2 classification reduces misclassified shadow pixels and resolves spatially heterogeneous vegetation gradients across urban and non-urban regions in SoCAB at 0.6-10 m resolution with 85% overall accuracy and 88% weighted overall accuracy.

The anthropogenic activities such as burning fossil fuel, power generation, agriculture, industry, polluting water bodies and urban activities are responsible for increasing GHG footprint of which 72% constitute CO2. GHG footprint needs to be in balance with sequestration of carbon to sustain ecosystem functions. Forests are the major carbon sinks (about 45%) that aid in mitigating global warming. The current research focusses on the carbon budgeting through quantification of emissions and sinks in the forest ecosystems and changes in climatic conditions of Western Ghats. This would help in evolving appropriate mitigation strategies toward sustainable management of forests and mitigate impacts of global warming. The land-use land-cover (LULC) dynamics are the prime driver of climate change due to the loss of carbon sequestration potential as well as emissions. The Western Ghats are one among 36 global biodiversity hotspots and forests in this region sequester atmospheric carbon, which aid in moderating the global climate and sustaining water to ensure water and food security in the peninsular India. Assessment of LULC dynamics using temporal remote sensing data shows the decline of evergreen forest by 5% with an increase in agriculture, plantations and built-up area. The interior or intact forests have declined by 10%, and they are now confined to protected areas. The simulation of likely changes indicates that the region will have only 10% evergreen cover and 17% agriculture, 40% plantations and 5% built-up. Quantification of carbon reveals that the WG forest ecosystem holds 1.23 MGg (million gigagrams or Gt) in vegetation and soils. The annual incremental carbon is about 37,507.3 Gg, (or 37.5 million tons, Mt) and the highest in the forests of Karnataka part of WG. Simulation of the likely changes in carbon content indicates the loss of 0.23 MGg (2018–2031) carbon sequestration potential under business as usual scenario. The conservation scenario depicts an increase in carbon sequestration potential of WG forests with the protection. Sequestered carbon in WG is about INR 100 billion ($1.4 billion) at carbon trading of INR 2142 ($30) per tonne. Large-scale land-cover changes leading to deforestation has contributed to an increase in mean temperature by 0.5°C and decline in rainy days, which necessitates evolving prudent landscape management strategies involving all stakeholders for conservation of ecologically fragile WG. This will enhance the ability of forests to sequester atmospheric carbon and climate moderation, with the sustenance of ecosystem goods and services. © 2019, International Association for Mathematical Geosciences.","Carbon sequestration; Climate change; Land-use dynamics; Modeling; Western Ghats",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075198502

However, the major sources of high-resolution images are not owned by China. The Chinese ""High Resolution Earth Observation Systems"" was deployed in 2010, and several major projects have been implemented. The present study focused on assessing the feasibility of Gaofen (GF) multi-spectral data for monitoring bare soil organic carbon (SOC) at field and regional scales. The data sources are hyperspectra measured under laboratory conditions and simulated multi-spectral data from GF-1 remote sensing images. Partial least squares regression (PLSR) was used to estimate SOC. At the field scale, the SOC hyperspectral prediction model produced better R2=0.9688, RMSE=0.3818, and RPD=5.6393 than the simulated multi-spectral SOC prediction model (R2=0.8179, RMSE=0.9913, RPD=2.3401). At a regional scale, the SOC hyperspectral prediction model also produced a better R2=0.9319, RMSE=1.097, and RPD=3.8758 than the simulated multi-spectral SOC predicted model (R2=0.8445, RMSE=1.6574, RPD=2.4228). For the simulated GF-1 multi-spectra model, regional scale predications had advantages over field scale predictions. The spatial distribution characteristics of SOC measurements and predictions from hyperspectral data and simulated GF-1 multi-spectral data were similar.

Hence, there is a strong demand for mapping and monitoring critical soil properties and in particular soil organic carbon (SOC). Pilot studies have demonstrated the potential for remote sensing techniques for SOC mapping in croplands. It has, however, been shown that the assessment of SOC may be hampered by the condition of the soil surface. While growing vegetation can be readily detected by means of the well-known Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), the distinction between bare soil and crop residues is expressed in the shortwave infrared region (SWIR), which is only covered by two broad bands in Landsat or Sentinel-2 imagery. Here we tested the effect of thresholds for the Cellulose Absorption Index (CAI), on the performance of SOC prediction models for cropland soils. Airborne Prism Experiment (APEX) hyperspectral images covering an area of 240 km2 in the Belgian Loam Belt were used together with a local soil dataset. We used the partial least square regression (PLSR) model to estimate the SOC content based on 104 georeferenced calibration samples (NDVI &lt; 0.26), firstly without setting a CAI threshold, and obtained a satisfactory result (coefficient of determination (R2) = 0.49, Ratio of Performance to Deviation (RPD) = 1.4 and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) = 2.13 g kgC-1 for cross-validation). However, a cross comparison of the estimated SOC values to grid-based measurements of SOC content within three fields revealed a systematic overestimation for fields with high residue cover. We then tested different CAI thresholds in order to mask pixels with high residue cover. The best model was obtained for a CAI threshold of 0.75 (R2 = 0.59, RPD = 1.5 and RMSE = 1.75 g kgC-1 for cross-validation). These results reveal that the purity of the pixels needs to be assessed aforehand in order to produce reliable SOC maps. The Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR2) index based on the SWIR bands of the MSI Sentinel 2 sensor extracted from images collected nine days before the APEX flight campaign correlates well with the CAI index of the APEX imagery. However, the NBR2 index calculated from Sentinel 2 images under moist conditions is poorly correlated with residue cover. This can be explained by the sensitivity of the NBR2 index to both soil moisture and residues. © 2020 by the authors.","Cellulose absorption index; Crop residues; Hyperspectral data; Partial least squares regression; Soil organic carbon mapping","Agricultural robots; Agricultural wastes; Crops; Infrared radiation; Mapping; Mean square error; Organic carbon; Pixels; Soil moisture; Spectroscopy; Vegetation; Airborne prism experiments; Cellulose absorption indices; Coefficient of determination; Normalized difference vegetation index; Partial least square regression; Remote sensing techniques; Root mean square errors; Soil organic carbon; Remote sensing; Farm Crops; Infrared Radiation; Mapping; Plants; Remote Sensing; Spectroscopy","English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086997121

This integration of agriculture and forestry is frequently seen as an option that can secure food security and co-deliver a range of environmental benefits. However, quantitative studies simultaneously integrating multiple aspects of agroforestry are rare. Focusing on four sustainability goals, namely adaptation to climate change, biodiversity conservation, climate change mitigation and rural development, this study investigated co-benefits and adverse side-effects of shaded agroforests above cocoa, coffee, oil palm, banana and citrus plantations in tropical humid West Africa. Time series of remote sensing land cover datasets were used to quantify and map recent land cover transitions in the region, and a field study in 25 agroforestry plots in Togo provided biomass carbon measurements in over 3000 trees, in addition to local farmers interviews. Estimates of theoretical agroforestry expansion and associated carbon sequestration potential in the region were compared to regional emissions from fossil fuels and deforestation. We found that about 1.6 Mha of losses in evergreen forests occurred between 1992 and 2015 (corresponding to 17% of the forest area originally present in 1992), while agricultural areas increased by 2.4 Mha (+5% relative to 1992). On average, trees in the studied agroforestry plots store 83.7 ± 7.0 t C/ha. We found synergies between rural development and adaptation benefits, no clear relationship between biodiversity and carbon storage, and a trade-off between high carbon stocks and crop yields. This trade-off can be minimized with an optimal management of agroforestry by using a mix of tree species that store medium carbon stocks and can enhance yields, soil fertility and climate resilience. In general, plant functional diversity, i.e. a balanced mix of shade trees, fruit trees, palms and bananas, emerged as a key feature of successful agroforestry systems. Besides, agroforestry trees co-products are reported as an additional, diversified source of income for local farmers. A large-scale deployment of agroforestry over seven countries in West Africa can sequester up to 135 Mt CO2/year over two decades, corresponding to about 166% of the carbon emissions from fossil fuels and deforestation in the region.

The hyperspectral inversion analysis of SOM traditionally relies on laboratory chemical testing methods, which have the disadvantages of being inefficient and time-consuming. In this study, 69 soil samples were collected from the Honghu farmland area and a mining area in northwest China. After pretreatment, 10 spectral indicators were obtained. Ridge regression, kernel ridge regression, Bayesian ridge regression, and AdaBoost algorithms were then used to construct the SOM hyperspectral inversion model based on the characteristic bands, and the accuracy of the models was compared. The results showed that the AdaBoost algorithm based on a grid search had the best accuracy in the different regions. For the mining area in northwest China, Rp 2 = 0.91, RMSEp = 0.22, and MAEp = 0.2. For the Honghu farmland area, Rp 2 = 0.86, RMSEp = 0.72, and MAEp = 0.56. The detection of SOM content using hyperspectral technology has the characteristics of a high detection precision and high speed, which will be of great significance for the rapid development of precision agriculture. © 2020 by the authors.

This study aimed to explore the potential of airborne hyperspectral image to estimate the SOC of bare topsoil at an agricultural site located in the southeast part of Iowa State, United States. To magnify the subtle spectral signals concerning SOC, and accelerate calibration and improve predictive ability, we developed a framework to combine two advanced spectral algorithms, namely, fractional-order derivative (FOD) and optimal band combination algorithm for SOC predicting. Our case was based on 49 soil samples and a scattered airborne hyperspectral image. Random forest (RF) was utilized to establish SOC estimation models by incorporating the optimal spectral indices processed by different FOD transformations on the basis of the optimal band combination algorithm. Results indicated that when the fractional order increased, overlapping peaks and baseline drifts were gradually removed. However, the magnitude of spectral strength decreased concurrently. More detailed and abundant spectral variability was captured by FOD as compared with those by original reflectance and first and second derivatives. The estimation accuracies developed from the optimal band combination algorithm (cross-validation R2, 0.36–0.66) were generally better than those from full-spectrum data (cross-validation R2, 0.32–0.54). The RF model based on the combination of 0.75-order reflectance and optimal band combination algorithm obtained the highest estimation accuracy for SOC with cross-validation R2 of 0.66. This research provides guidance for future studies in selecting the most appropriate FOD transformation to preprocess spectral data and in using the optimal band combination algorithm to determine the spectral index. Airborne hyperspectral image-based modeling can be further used to map agricultural topsoil SOC to support local-scale agricultural planning. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Airborne hyperspectral image; Fractional-order derivative; Optimal band combination algorithm; Random forest; Soil organic carbon","Agriculture; Decision trees; Metadata; Reflection; Soils; Spectroscopy; Agricultural planning; Agricultural topsoils; Band combinations; Fractional order derivatives; Predictive abilities; Random forests; Soil organic carbon; Spectral variability; Organic carbon; airborne sensing; algorithm; calibration; fractionation; multispectral image; organic carbon; remote sensing; soil organic matter; soil quality; spectral reflectance; topsoil; Iowa; United States","English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078705927

This paper presents results from the SolumScire project, focusing on the prediction of the spatial distribution of soil zones and topsoil properties, such as pH, soil organic matter (SOM) and clay content in agricultural fields through random forest algorithms. For this purpose, samples from 120 fields were investigated. The zoning and soil property prediction has an accuracy greater than 90%. This is supported by a high agreement of the derived zones with farmer's observations. The trained models revealed a prediction accuracy of 94%, 89% and 96% for pH, SOM and clay content, respectively.

In some regions, shifting precipitation patterns in the spring and fall are negatively impacting farm operation by reducing the number of “workable days” or the days fields can be worked with heavy equipment without damaging soil structure. This can be particularly problematic for farms on clay soils and/or poor drainage. Approximating a water content threshold at which a soil is not workable due to soil structure destruction can be helpful for planning effective farm operations. In this study, we applied advanced remote sensing and machine learning tools to produce digital maps of soil organic carbon (SOC) and clay (CL) content and used them in existing pedotransfer functions (PTFs) to predict a workability threshold (WT) across a study area in Delta, British Columbia, Canada. We combined field data, soil and vegetation indices derived from multiple Landsat satellite images, topographic indices, and soil survey information to digitally map SOC and CL of the agricultural lands in Delta using random forest (RF) and generalized boosted regression model (GBM). When validated against an independent field dataset, the RF model outperformed GBM for all accuracy measures (coefficient of determination – R2, concordance correlation coefficient – CCC, and normalized root mean square error – nRMSE). We then spatially applied several PTFs using our digital maps to estimate the plasticity limits of the soil and produce WT map. The WT map was then tested against independent field samples of the soil water content at −10 kPa and we achieved R2 of 0.59, CCC of 0.70, and nRMSE of 0.15. Our analysis showed that 40% of the fields in the study area had WT &lt; 30%, a threshold that is already being impacted by reduced workable days. This WT map could be used to improve spatial prioritizations of investments for climate change adaptation at farm to regional scales. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Clay content; Landsat indices; Random forest; Soil organic carbon; Soil plasticity limits","Agriculture; Clay; Decision trees; Mean square error; Organic carbon; Plasticity; Regression analysis; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Soil moisture; Soil surveys; Clay content; LANDSAT; Random forests; Soil organic carbon; Soil plasticity; Climate change; adaptive management; agricultural production; algorithm; clay; climate change; digital mapping; Landsat; mapping method; NDVI; organic carbon; plasticity; prediction; regression analysis; remote sensing; satellite imagery; soil analysis; soil carbon; soil structure; soil survey; threshold; British Columbia; Canada","English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077808358

PNW-GTR-984. Portland, OR: U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Pacific Northwest Research Station. 66 p. Given the increasing interest in the use of lidar-based remote sensing to support carbon monitoring systems, including those used for measurement, reporting, and verification requirements for REDD+ (reduced emissions from deforestation and degradation) programs in tropical nations, there is a corresponding need for the cost-effective field measurement systems to enable model development and robust assessment of uncertainty in these programs. In this report, we describe an efficient field sampling design and measurement protocol designed to provide field-based estimates of biomass/carbon stored in trees and coarse woody materials to support complex, multilevel carbon monitoring systems using Landsat time series and airborne lidar. Airborne lidar data were collected as a strip sample (single flight lines spaced 5 km apart) at six sites in the United States (Colorado, Maine, Minnesota, Oregon, Pennsylvania/New Jersey, and South Carolina) (298 total flight lines), and about 50 field plots were established within the lidar coverage at each site. Field plots were distributed across 15 (3 cover x 5 height) strata at each site, using field protocols that were consistent with those of the U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis program. Field measurements were collected digitally on personal tablets and uploaded daily into a database.

The purpose of this study was to predict soil organic carbon content in the mountainous terrain of eastern Lesotho, southern Africa, which is an area of high endemic biodiversity as well as an area extensively used for small-scale agriculture. An integrated field and laboratory approach was undertaken, through measurements of reflectance spectra of soil using an Analytical Spectral Device (ASD) FieldSpec® 4 optical sensor. Soil spectra were collected on the land surface under field conditions and then on soil in the laboratory, in order to assess the accuracy of field spectroscopy-based models. The predictive performance of two different statistical models (random forest and partial least square regression) was compared. Results show that random forest regression can most accurately predict the soil organic carbon contents on an independent dataset using the field spectroscopy data. In contrast, the partial least square regression model overfits the calibration dataset. Important wavelengths to predict soil organic contents were localised around the visible range (400-700 nm).

Samples were collected in three different layers, at 0-10, 10-20 and 20-30 cm depth (IPCC guidelines for Greenhouse Gas Inventories Programme in 2006). Analyses were performed by C Loss-On-Ignition, X-ray diffraction and water content by the Richards plates method. Significant differences for SOC, gypsum, and CaCO3 were found between layers; similarly, soil reflectance for 30 cm depth layers was higher. The resulting PLSR models (60 samples for calibration and 30 independent samples for validation) yielded good predictions for SOC (R2 = 0.74), moderate prediction ability for gypsum and were not accurate for the rest of rest of soil components. Importantly, SOC content was related to water available capacity. Soils with high reflectance features held c.a. 40% less water than soils with less reflectance. Therefore, higher reflectance can be related to degradation in gypsiferous soil.

The Nile delta provides two thirds of Egypt's agriculture land, but is threatened by urban sprawl. The paper aims to quantify urban expansion over a 45 year period using 6 time points from 1972 to 2017, and its impacts on agricultural potential, soil organic carbon stocks, and implications for water use. The study used multi-temporal satellite data and remote sensing techniques (Maximum Likelihood supervised classification, and NDVI), soil sampling and analysis, data on water irrigation, and agroecological system and ecosystem services model (MicroLEIS, InVEST) to assess the effects of land use change. Urban area increased by a factor of 5, from 452 km2 in 1972 to 2644 km2 in 2017. The greatest losses occurred to the fertile Vertic Torrifluvent soils on the older delta, which lost 1734 km2. Soil organic carbon (0–75 cm depth) lost as a result of soil sealing from urbanisation rose from 25,000 to 141,000 Mg C over the 45 years. As a result of increased pressure on delta land, agriculture expanded into the higher desert areas outside the delta, on marginal land sustained by intensive fertiliser use and irrigation, which in turn puts pressure on water use. Therefore, rapid urban expansion has resulted in a loss of soil carbon and a shift in agriculture from fertile soils to marginal soils, requiring more capital inputs, which is ultimately less sustainable. Modelling suggested that soil management improvement could make better use of fertile soils within the Delta currently affected by high salinity and poor drainage. Future planning should encourage urban expansion on the less fertile soils outside of the delta, while improving suitability of existing agricultural land and minimising land degradation within the delta. © 2019","InVEST ecosystem services model; NDVI; Soil organic carbon; Urban sprawl; Water use","organic carbon; water; carbon; agricultural land; agroecology; fertilizer application; irrigation system; land degradation; organic carbon; soil carbon; soil fertility; urban sprawl; urbanization; water use; agricultural land; Article; controlled study; cultivated land; ecosystem; environmental impact; environmental parameters; fluid intake; normalized difference vegetation index; remote sensing; rural area; salinity; soil depth; soil fertility; soil management; soil quality; spatiotemporal analysis; stock assessment; urban area; urbanization; agriculture; Egypt; soil; Egypt; Nile Delta; Agriculture; Carbon; Ecosystem; Egypt; Soil; Urbanization","English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072867866

Accurately mapping SOM at regional scales is of critical importance for sustainable agriculture and soil utilization management and remains a grand challenge. Many studies used soil sampling data and machine learning algorithms to predict SOM at regional scales for a given year, while few studies mapped SOM for multiple years and examined its temporal dynamics. We compared the performance of four machine learning algorithms: decision tree (DT), bagging decision tree (BDT), random forest (RF), and gradient boosting regression trees (GBRT) in mapping SOM in Hubei province, China over the 18-year period from 2000 to 2017. Our results showed that RF and DT had the highest coefficient of determination (R 2 ) (0.61) and the lowest potential bias (9.48 g/kg), respectively, while GBRT had the lowest mean error (ME) (1.26 g/kg), root mean squared error (RMSE) (5.41 g/kg) and Lin's concordance correlation coefficient (LCCC) (0.72). The SOM map based on GBRT better captured the distribution of the soil sample data than that based on RF. The trained GBRT model and the spatially explicitly data on explanatory variables (e.g., climate, terrain, remote sensing) were used to predict SOM for each 500 m × 500 m grid cell in Hubei for the period from 2000 to 2017. Our results showed that the SOM content of cropland was relatively high in the southeast and relatively low in the north. The SOM content in the topsoil varied from 0.89 to 58.86 g/kg and was averaged at 20.52 g/kg. The mean cropland SOM content of the province exhibited an increasing trend from 2000 to 2017 with an increase of 0. 26 g/kg and a growth rate of 1.28%. Spatially, the SOM content increased in southern Hubei and decreased in central and northern parts of the province. A large portion of the areas with decreasing SOM content in northern Hubei was reclaimed cropland, while a large part of the high-quality cropland with rising SOM content in the east (~0.45 × 10 4 ha) was lost due to land use change (e.g., urbanization). © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Cropland; Digital soil mapping; Machine learning algorithms; MODIS; Multi-year; Soil organic carbon","Adaptive boosting; Agriculture; Biogeochemistry; Biological materials; Climate models; Data mining; Decision trees; Ecosystems; Land use; Learning systems; Mapping; Mean square error; Organic carbon; Radiometers; Remote sensing; Soil surveys; Soils; Cropland; Digital soil mappings; MODIS; Multi-year; Soil organic carbon; Machine learning; soil organic matter; agricultural land; algorithm; digital mapping; machine learning; MODIS; soil carbon; soil organic matter; Article; bagging decision tree; China; climate; correlation coefficient; cropland; decision tree; gradient boosting regression tree; land use; machine learning; measurement error; priority journal; random forest; remote sensing; satellite imagery; soil analysis; soil chemistry; China; Hubei","English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062969336

The international initiative ""4 per 1000"" aims at implementing practical actions on increasing soil carbon storage in soils under agriculture. This requires a fundamental understanding of the soil carbon changes across the globe. Several studies have suggested that the global soil organic carbon stocks (SOCS) have decreased due to global warming and land cover change, while others reported SOCS may increase under climate change and improved soil management. To better understand how a changing climate, land cover, and agricultural activities influence SOCS across large extents and long periods, the spatial and temporal variations of SOCS were estimated using a modified space-for-time substitution method over a 150-year period in the state of Wisconsin, USA. We used legacy soil datasets and environmental factors collected and estimated at different times across the state (169,639 km2) coupled with a machine-learning algorithm. The legacy soil datasets were collected from 1980 to 2002 from 550 soil profiles and harmonized to 0.30 m depth. The environmental factors consisted of 100-m soil property maps, 1-km annual temperature and precipitation maps, 250-m remote-sensing (i.e., Landsat)-derived yearly land cover maps and a 30-m digital elevation model. The model performance was moderate but can provide insights on understanding the impacts of different factors on SOCS changes across a large spatial and temporal extent. SOCS at the 0-0.30 m decreased at a rate of 0.1 ton ha-1 year-1 between 1850 and 1938 and increased at 0.2 ton ha-1 year-1 between 1980 and 2002. The spatial variation in SOCS at 0-0.30 m was mainly affected by land cover and soil types with the largest SOCS found in forest and wetland and Spodosols. The loss between 1850 and 1980 was most likely due to land cover change while the increase between 1980 and 2002 was due to best soil management practices (e.g., decreased erosion, reduced tillage, crop rotation and use of legume and cover crops). © 2019 by the authors.","4 per 1000; Best management practice; Carbon pool; Carbon sink; Climate change; Industrial revolution","Agronomy; Climate change; Crops; Forestry; Global warming; Land use; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Organic carbon; Remote sensing; 4 per 1000; Best management practices; Carbon pool; Carbon sink; Industrial revolutions; Soils","English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068193483

These data enable monitoring of a wide variety of soil properties but pose important methodological challenges. Highly correlated hyperspectral spectral bands can affect the prediction and accuracy as well as the interpretability of the retrieval model. Therefore, the spectral dimension needs to be reduced through a selection of specific spectral bands or regions that are most helpful to describing SOC. This study evaluates the efficiency of visible near-infrared (VNIR) and shortwave near-infrared (SWIR) hyperspectral data to identify the most informative hyperspectral bands responding to SOC content in agricultural soils. Soil samples (111) were collected over an agricultural field in southern Ontario, Canada and analyzed against two hyperspectral datasets: An airborne Nano-Hyperspec imaging sensor with 270 bands (400-1000 nm) and a laboratory hyperspectral dataset (ASD FieldSpec 3) along the 1000-2500 nm range (NIR-SWIR). In parallel, a multimethod modeling approach consisting of random forest, support vector machine, and partial least squares regression models was used to conduct band selections and to assess the validity of the selected bands. The multimethod model resulted in a selection of optimal band or regions over the VNIR and SWIR sensitive to SOC and potentially for mapping. The bands that achieved the highest respective importance values were 711-715, 727, 986-998, and 433-435 nm regions (VNIR); and 2365-2373, 2481-2500, and 2198-2206 nm (NIR-SWIR). Some of these bands are in agreement with the absorption features of SOC reported in the literature, whereas others have not been reported before. Ultimately, the selection of optimal band and regions is of importance for quantification of agricultural SOC and would provide a new framework for creating optimized SOC-specific sensors. © 2019 by the authors.","Agricultural soils; Airborne hyperspectral imaging; Feature selection; Hyperspectral; Imaging spectroscopy; Multimethod modeling approach; Remote sensing; Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)","Agriculture; Decision trees; Feature extraction; Infrared devices; Infrared radiation; Least squares approximations; Monitoring; Organic carbon; Regression analysis; Remote sensing; Soils; Spectroscopy; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Agricultural soils; Airborne hyperspectral imaging; HyperSpectral; Imaging spectroscopy; Model approach; Hyperspectral imaging","English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067419006

SOC is one of the critical factors in food production and plays an important role in the climate change because it affects the physio-chemical soil characteristics, plant growth, and contributes to sustainable development on global levels. For the purpose of our investigations, 120 soil samples (0-30 cm) were collected throughout different land uses and soil types of the study area. Multiple linear regressions (MLR) were used to investigate the spatiotemporal relationship of SOC, soil characteristics, and environmental factors. Remote sensing data acquired from Landsat 5 TM in July 1995 and operational land imager (OLI) in July 2018 were used to model SOC pool. The results revealed significant variations of soil organic carbon pool (SOCP) among different soil textures and land-uses. Soil with high clay content revealed an increase in the percentage of soil organic carbon, and had mean SOCP of 6.08 ± 1.91 Mg C ha-1, followed by clay loams and loamy soils. The higher values of SOCP were observed in the northern regions of the study area. The phenomenon is associated with the expansion of the human activity of initiating fish ponds that reflected higher values of SOC that were related to the organic additions used as nutrients for fish. Nevertheless, the SOC values decreased in southeast of the study area with the decrease of soil moisture contents and the increase in the heavy texture profiles. As a whole, our findings pointed out that the human factor has had a significant impact on the variation of soil organic carbon values in the Eastern Nile Delta from 1995 to 2018. As land use changes from agricultural activity to fish ponds, the SOCP significantly increased. The agriculture land-use revealed higher SOCP with 60.77 Mg C ha-1 in clay soils followed by fish ponds with 53.43 Mg C ha-1. The results also showed a decrease in SOCP values due to an increasing in land surface temperature (LST) thus highlighting that influence of temperature and ambient soil conditions linked to land-use changes have a marked impact on surface SOCP and C sequestration. © 2019 by the authors.","GIS; Land use/land cover; Remote sensing indices; Spatiotemporal Evaluation","climate change; GIS; human activity; land cover; land use change; Landsat; remote sensing; satellite imagery; soil carbon; soil organic matter; spatiotemporal analysis; Egypt; Nile Delta","English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067072251

While this approach provides SOC estimates at specific sampling points, geo-statistical or interpolation techniques are required to infer continuous spatial information. UAS-based proximal or remote sensing has the potential to provide detailed and spatially explicit spectral sampling of the topsoil at the field or even watershed scale. However, the factors affecting the quality of spectral acquisition under outdoor conditions need to be considered. In this study, we investigate the capabilities of two portable hyperspectral sensors (STS-VIS and STS-NIR), and two small-form multispectral cameras with narrow bands in the VIS-NIR region (Parrot Sequoia and Mini-MCA6), to predict SOC content. We collected spectral data under both controlled laboratory and outdoor conditions, with the latter being affected by variable illumination and atmospheric conditions and sensor-sample distance. We also analysed the transferability of the prediction models between different measurement setups by aligning spectra acquired under different conditions (laboratory and outdoor) or by different instruments. Our results indicate that UAS-compatible small-form sensors can be used to reliably estimate SOC. The results show that: (i) the best performance for SOC estimation under outdoor conditions was obtained using the VIS-NIR range, while the addition of the SWIR region decreased the prediction accuracy; (ii) prediction models using only the narrow bands of multispectral cameras gave similar or better performances than those using continuous spectra from the STS hyperspectral sensors; and (iii) when used in outdoor conditions, the micro hyperspectral sensors substantially benefitted from a laboratory model calibration followed by a spectral transfer using an internal soil standard. Based on this analysis, we recommend VIS-NIR portable instruments for estimating spatially distributed SOC data. The integration of these sensors in UAS-mapping devices could represent a cost-effective solution for soil research and precision farming applications when high resolution data are required. © 2019 by the authors.","Hyperspectral sensors; Multispectral sensors; Precision agriculture; Proximal sensing; Soil organic carbon","assessment method; detection method; equipment; estimation method; instrumentation; organic carbon; precision agriculture; prediction; remote sensing; satellite data; satellite sensor; soil carbon; topsoil; watershed; Psittacidae","English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064086655

The present study was applied to estimate the SOC stock using space-borne satellite data (Landsat 4–5 Thematic Mapper [TM]) and ground verification in the Medinipur Block, Paschim Medinipur District and West Bengal in India. In total, 50 soil samples were collected randomly from the region according to field surveys using a hand-held Global Positioning System (GPS) unit to estimate the surface SOC concentrations in the laboratory. Bare soil index (BSI) and normalized difference vegetation ndex (NDVI) were explored from TM data. The satellite data-derived indices were used to estimate spatial distribution of SOC using multivariate regression model. The regression analysis was performed to determine the relationship between SOC and spectral indices (NDVI and BSI) and compared the observed SOC (field measure) to predict SOC (estimated from satellite images). Goodness fit test was performed to determine the significance of the relationship between observed and predicted SOC at p ≤ 0.05 level. The results of regression analysis between observed SOC and NDVI values showed significant relationship (R2 = 0.54; p &lt; 0.0075). A significant statistical relationship (r = −0.72) was also observed between SOC and BSI.

Land conversions in the form of agriculture, aquaculture and urbanization account for much of the deforestation of mangrove wetlands. However, natural processes at the transition zone between land and ocean can also rapidly change mangrove spread. In this study, we applied a robust field-based carbon inventory and new structural and temporal remote sensing techniques to quantify the magnitude and change of mangrove carbon stocks in major deltas across Africa and Asia. From 2000-2016, approximately 1.6% (12 270 ha) of the total mangrove area within these deltas disappeared, primarily through erosion and conversion to agriculture. However, the rapid expansion of mangroves in some regions during this same period resulted in new forests that were taller and more carbon-dense than the deforested areas. Because of the rapid vertical growth rates and horizontal expansion, new mangrove forests were able to offset the total carbon losses of 5 332 843 Mg C by 44%. Each hectare of new mangrove forest accounted for ∼84% to ∼160% of the aboveground carbon for each hectare of mangrove forest lost, regardless of the net change in mangrove area. Our study highlights the significance of the natural dynamics of erosion and sedimentation on carbon loss and sequestration potential for mangroves over time. Areas of naturally regenerating mangroves will have a much larger carbon sequestration potential if the rate of mangrove deforestation of taller forests is curbed. © 2019 The Author(s).

In addition, the role of precision agriculture such as, remote sensing in soilless system performance is reviewed. Soilless substrate source (organic and inorganic) and particle size can affect mineral content, oxygen level, salinity and pH of the nutrient solution, as well as the microorganism diversity and abundance. Organic substrates had more microorganism communities compared to inorganic substrates. Microorganism inoculation (e.g. fungi) of inorganic substrate to increase microorganism abundance is completely ineffective. However, environmentalists do not recommend the use of peat-based organic substrates because it leads to loss of soil organic carbon and destruction of wetlands. Agricultural demands for sustainable, environmental friendly soilless system highlights the benefits of using inorganic substrate (rock-wool and volcanic tuff) and the re-use of nutrient solution (closed systems) to avoid water and nutrient losses. Interestingly, biological control of root rot pathogens in closed soilless systems is more effective than open or conventional due to the lower variety of microorganism community in closed structures. However, substrate salinity is the main challenge in closed soilless systems. The use of salt-tolerance cultivars, large volume tanks to minimize electrical conductivity and pH changes and sub irrigation with low concentration nutrient solution are the main approaches to reduce salinity in growing substrates. Several precision agricultural techniques based on advanced sensing technologies such as smart irrigation systems and surface reflectance data from crop canopy may increase soilless system efficiency. These techniques are based on crop water demands, not fixed watering schedules and have the potential to optimize water and nutrient use efficiency. © 2019 Parlar Scientific Publications.

Digital soil mapping plays an important role in efficiently obtaining the spatial distribution of SOC, which contributes to precision agriculture. However, traditional soil-forming factors (i.e., terrain or climatic factors) have weak variability in low-relief areas, such as plains, and cannot reflect the spatial variation of soil attributes. Meanwhile, vegetation cover hinders the acquisition of the direct information of farmland soil. Thus, useful environmental variables should be utilized for SOC prediction and the digital mapping of such areas. SOC has an important effect on crop growth status, and remote sensing data can record the apparent spectral characteristics of crops. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) is an important index reflecting crop growth and biomass. This study used NDVI time series data rather than traditional soil-forming factors to map SOC. Honghu City, located in the middle of the Jianghan Plain, was selected as the study region, and the NDVI time series data extracted from Landsat 8 were used as the auxiliary variables. SOC maps were estimated through stepwise linear regression (SLR), partial least squares regression (PLSR), support vector machine (SVM), and artificial neural network (ANN). Ordinary kriging (OK) was used as the reference model, while root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) and coefficient of determination of prediction (R2 P) were used to evaluate the model performance. Results showed that SOC had a significant positive correlation in July and August (0.17, 0.29) and a significant negative correlation in January, April, and December (-0.23, -0.27, and -0.23) with NDVI time series data. The best model for SOC prediction was generated by ANN, with the lowest RMSEP of 3.718 and highest R2 P of 0.391, followed by SVM (RMSEP = 3.753, R2 P = 0.361) and PLSR (RMSEP = 4.087, R2 P = 0.283). The SLR model was the worst model, with the lowest R2 P of 0.281 and highest RMSEP of 3.930. ANN and SVM were better than OK (RMSEP = 3.727, R2 P = 0.372), whereas PLSR and SLR were worse than OK. Moreover, the prediction results using single-data NDVI or short time series NDVI showed low accuracy. The effect of the terrain factor on SOC prediction represented unsatisfactory results. All these results indicated that the NDVI time series data can be used for SOC mapping in plain areas and that theANNmodel can maximally extract additional associated information between NDVI time series data and SOC. This study presented an effective method to overcome the selection of auxiliary variables for digital soil mapping in plain areas when the soil was covered with vegetation. This finding indicated that the time series characteristics of NDVI were conducive for predicting SOC in plains. © 2019 by the authors.","Digital soil mapping; Machine learning methods; NDVI time series; Prediction model; Soil organic carbon","Crops; Data mining; Forecasting; Forestry; Least squares approximations; Mapping; Mean square error; Neural networks; Organic carbon; Remote sensing; Soil surveys; Support vector machines; Time series; Vegetation; Digital soil mappings; Machine learning methods; NDVI time series; Prediction model; Soil organic carbon; Soils","English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071574866

For both 1970–1990 and 1990–2010, the results showed successive decrease in farmlands (2.8 × 10 5 ha or −9.15% and 5.9 × 10 5 ha or −20.49%, respectively) and grasslands (3.4 × 10 4 ha or −10.73% and 1.5 × 10 5 ha or −54.1%, respectively), and continuous increase in forests (2.0 × 10 4 ha or 0.33% and 1.7 × 10 5 ha or 2.81%, respectively) and built-up lands (2.07 × 10 5 ha or 78.41% and 6.49 × 10 5 ha or 137.8%, respectively). From 1970 to 1990, approximately 8.3 Tg of the total carbon sink declined, including a 0.4 Tg reduction in vegetation carbon and a 7.9 Tg reduction in SOC. While from 1990 to 2010, approximately 17.5 Tg of carbon storage declined, comprising a 2.8 Tg of carbon accumulated by vegetation, and a 20.3 Tg reduction in SOC. Overall, LUCC has resulted in huge amount of carbon emissions in Zhejiang from 1970 to 2010.

Soil texture is also used to calculate soil's ability to retain water for plant growth. SOC and soil texture are thus important parameters of agricultural soils and need to be regularly monitored. Optical satellite remote sensing offers the potential for frequent surveys over large areas. In addition, the recently-operated Sentinel-2 missions provide free imagery. This study compared the capabilities of Sentinel-2 for monitoring and mapping of SOC and soil texture (clay, silt and sand content) with those obtained from airborne hyperspectral (CASI/SASI sensors) and lab ASD FieldSpec spectroradiometer measurements at four agricultural sites in the Czech Republic. Combination of 10 extracted bands of the Sentinel-2 and 18 spectral indices, as independent variables, were used to train prediction models and then produce spatial distribution maps of the selected attributes. Results showed that the prediction accuracy based on lab spectroscopy, airborne and Sentinel-2 in the majority of the sites was adequate for SOC and fair for clay; however, Sentinel-2 imagery could not be used to detect and map variations in silt and sand. The SOC and clay maps derived from the airborne and spaceborne datasets showed similar trend, with both performing better where SOC levels were relatively high, though at the highest levels Sentinel-2 was able to create the SOC map more precisely than the airborne sensors.

Here, we demonstrate how robust data on carbon uptake in croplands can be obtained by combining multiple sources to enhance the reliability of estimates. Using yield statistics, a remote-sensing based productivity algorithm and climate-sensitive potential productivity, we mapped the potential to increase crop productivity and compared consistent carbon uptake information of agricultural land with forests. The productivity gap in Europe is higher in Eastern and Southern than in Central-Western countries. At continental scale, European agriculture shows a greater carbon uptake in harvestable compartments than forests (agriculture 1.96 vs. forests 1.76 t C ha−1 year−1). Mapping productivity gaps allows efforts to enhance crop production to be prioritized by, for example, improved crop cultivars, nutrient management or pest control.

The objective of this study was to explore the scale-dependent effects of environmental factors on SOC distribution and to predict SOC based on their scale-specific relationships using wavelet transform. The spatial data of SOC, slope, soil water content (SWC), soil bulk density (SBD), sand, silt, and Landsat 8 remote sensing reflectance (Rrs) were extracted at 330 m interval along three transects in the arable land of Taiyuan basin, China. The spatial series of SOC and environmental variables along each of three transects were separated into six detail components and one approximation representing different scales using wavelet decomposition. The specific scale of each detail component was identified by Hilbert transform. The SOC variances over the entire basin were mainly explained (54%–86%) by scales of 12.70 and 21.12 km. Compared with the relationships between SOC and environmental factors at sampling scale, their multiscale correlations were better at larger scales. The SOC estimation using wavelet reconstruction based on predicted SOC at all scale components outperformed its prediction using stepwise multiple linear regression (SMLR) based on the original sampling data. The major contributing scale to SOC prediction was 12.70 km over the entire basin. In the prediction of overall SOC, Rrs was the major predictor in the upstream and downstream portions, whereas soil texture was the major contributor in the midstream portion. In this study, the SOC prediction using wavelet transform based on scale-dependent relationships with environmental variables generated new insights in soil properties estimation, and wavelet transform has potential for determining the multiscale relationships of soil properties with influencing factors. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Covariates; Inverse discrete wavelet transform (IDWT); Scale; Soil organic carbon (SOC); Wavelet transform","Agriculture; Discrete wavelet transforms; Environmental management; Forecasting; Linear regression; Organic carbon; Remote sensing; Rivers; Signal reconstruction; Soil moisture; Wavelet transforms; Covariates; Dependent relationship; Environmental variables; Inverse discrete wavelet transforms; Remote-sensing reflectance; Scale; Soil organic carbon; Stepwise multiple linear regression; Wavelet decomposition; comparative study; covariance analysis; decomposition analysis; discrete choice analysis; environmental factor; Landsat; organic carbon; remote sensing; sampling; scale effect; soil carbon; soil texture; spatial distribution; spectral reflectance; transform; wavelet analysis; China; Shanxi; Taiyuan Basin","English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047642498

The Land Surface Temperature (LST) derived from thermal infrared wavelength can be related with soil properties, particularly texture. The availability of LST data on a regular basis, with good spatial resolution to cover extensive agricultural regions and also integrated with reflectance data enhances its use in soil attributes mapping. The objectives of this research were to verify the relationships between soil attributes texture and organic carbon (OC) with the remote sensing (RS) products LST and surface reflectance and perform maps of classes of such attributes based on these variables. The study area (473 ha) is located near the municipality of Barra Bonita, southeast of São Paulo State, Brazil. A regular sampling grid with 100 × 100 m2 and with sampling density of one sample per hectare was established on the study site, from where surface samples (0–0.2 m) were collected via auger and had their contents determined by wet chemistry analysis. Images from Landsat 5 were obtained for extraction of LST and reflectance. The algorithm Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) was applied for soil attributes mapping using 55 toposequences samples and considering (a) three LST images; (b) only reflectance from one Landsat scene and (c) reflectance + LST from the same scene as in (b). Besides this, maps were performed using only one LST image with a histogram-based classification. The weighted kappa (kw) was calculated with validation samples and indicated the classification accuracy. Mapping of texture and OC through SAM algorithm produced better results than the classification of LST, regardless of the variables being considered. For both attributes, the best map was produced using reflectance + LST, with substantial agreement for texture and moderate for OC.

In global carbon cycle, semi-arid ecosystem plays a crucial role in interannual variability and greening trend. The vegetation carbon storage and its relation with drought in India are not well understood. The impact of drought on vegetation carbon storage is investigated using Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) and CASA (Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach) derived Net Primary Production (NPP) during 2001–2013. A strong positive correlation is found between regional NPP and SPEI. CASA derived NPP shows good agreement (R2 = 0.57, significance &gt; 95%) with field based observation in arid and semi-arid regions of Gujarat. A significant Increasing trend of 0.2 TgC Yr−1 (about 2 % per year) is observed during the period of 2001–2013. The highest decreased of 24% (2.79 TgC Yr−1) in NPP was found during 2002 and a notable increase of 17% (1.61 TgC Yr−1) was seen during 2013 due to consecutive drought and surplus rainfall years respectively. The study suggests that consecutive droughts have brought an immense impact on vegetation productivity. During the drought years, dry sub-humid region was the most vulnerable as it was dominated by agriculture land, while semi-arid region was less affected due to forest cover. Despite many droughts, some part of north-west and south-west regions had shown an increase in vegetation carbon storage, which indicates that these parts are not affected by the drought. The study also suggests that in addition to rainfall, heat wave also played a major limiting factor in vegetation productivity. The study will be useful in identifying the regions which are more vulnerable to drought. Present study, will also be helpful in combating the regional climate change as vegetation carbon storage is directly linked with agricultural productivity. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Arid and semi-arid regions; Drought; NPP; Remote sensing; SPEI",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85046681587

While land change impacts on ecosystem carbon dynamics have been the focus of numerous studies, few efforts have been based on observational data incorporating multiple ecosystem types spanning large geographic areas over long time horizons. In this study we use a variety of synoptic-scale remote sensing data to estimate the effect of LULC changes associated with urbanization, agricultural expansion and contraction, forest harvest, and wildfire on the carbon balance of terrestrial ecosystems (forest, grasslands, shrublands, and agriculture) in the conterminous United States (i.e. excluding Alaska and Hawaii) between 1973 and 2010. We estimate large net declines in the area of agriculture and forest, along with relatively small increases in grasslands and shrublands. The largest net change in any class was an estimated gain of 114 865 km2 of developed lands, an average rate of 3282 km2 yr-1. On average, US ecosystems sequestered carbon at an annual rate of 254 Tg C yr-1. In forest lands, the net sink declined by 35% over the study period, largely a result of land-use legacy, increasing disturbances, and reductions in forest area due to land use conversion. Uncertainty in LULC change data contributed to a ∼16% margin of error in the annual carbon sink estimate prior to 1985 (approximately ±40 Tg C yr-1). Improvements in LULC and disturbance mapping starting in the mid-1980s reduced this uncertainty by ∼50% after 1985. We conclude that changes in LULC are a critical component to understanding ecosystem carbon dynamics, and continued improvements in detection, quantification, and attribution of change have the potential to significantly reduce current uncertainties. © 2018 The Author(s).

The soil organic carbon was determined in 248 soil samples collected randomly within a 300 m2 grid overlaid on the study area. Out of the eight predictor variables used in simple regression, the normalized difference vegetation index has the maximum correlation with the soil organic carbon (0.64) followed by vegetation temperature condition index (0.60), brightness index (- 0.60), greenness index (0.57) and wetness index (0.51). Standardized principle components of the predictor variables were used in the prediction model so as to address the multicollinearity problem.

The main aim was to assess the potential of superspectral Sentinel-2 satellite for the prediction and mapping of the attribute. The prediction accuracy based on airborne and spaceborne techniques in majority of the sites was adequate for SOC. Comparing the spatial distribution maps of SOC derived from the airborne and spaceborne data showed a similar trend at both platforms. The SOC maps also confirmed that in areas with a high level of SOC, Sentinel-2 was able to detect SOC even more precisely than the airborne sensors. Although a decrease in the model and map performances was obvious in the case of parameters with low contents. The findings of the current research showed that superspectral Sentinel-2 allows for the estimation and mapping of SOC. The study also emphasized the importance of the superspectral Sentinel-2 data in soil characteristics assessment with a frequent revisit-time over larger areas than it currently is with laboratory and airborne instruments. Certainly, the repeatability of the Sentinel-2 products is still a work in progress and with the Sentinel-2B, a revisit-time of five-day and the temporal frequency of cloud-free acquisitions will be further increased.

To understand the contribution of understory carbon to the United States (US) carbon budget, we developed an approach that relies on field measurements of understory vegetation cover and height on US Department of Agriculture Forest Service, Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) subplots. Allometric models were developed to estimate aboveground understory carbon. A spatial model based on stand characteristics and remotely sensed data was also applied to estimate understory carbon on all FIA plots. We found that most understory carbon was comprised of woody shrub species (64%), followed by nonwoody forbs and graminoid species (35%) and seedlings (1%). The largest estimates were found in temperate or warm humid locations such as the Pacific Northwest and southeastern US, thus following the same broad trend as aboveground tree biomass. The average understory aboveground carbon density was estimated to be 0.977 Mg ha-1, for a total estimate of 272 Tg carbon across all managed forest land in the US (approximately 2% of the total aboveground live tree carbon pool).

A key reason for this omission is the cost and uncertainty of monitoring C at the farm scale in heterogeneous smallholder landscapes. A largely overlooked alternative is to monitor C at more aggregated scales and develop C contracts with groups of land owners, community organizations or C aggregators working across entire landscapes (e.g., watersheds, communities, municipalities, etc.). In this study we use a 100-km2 agricultural area in El Salvador to demonstrate how high-spatial resolution optical satellite imagery can be used to map aboveground woody biomass (AGWB) C at the landscape scale with very low uncertainty (95% probability of a deviation of less than 1%). Uncertainty of AGWB-C estimates remained low (&lt;5%) for areas as small as 250 ha, despite high uncertainties at the farm and plot scale (34–99%). We estimate that CSA adoption could more than double AGWB-C stocks on agricultural lands in the study area, and that utilizing AGWB-C maps to target denuded areas could increase C gains per unit area by 46%. The potential value of C credits under a plausible adoption scenario would range from $38,270 to $354,000 yr−1 for the study area, or about $13 to $124 ha−1 yr−1, depending on C prices. Considering farm sizes in smallholder landscapes rarely exceed 1–2 ha, relying solely on direct C payments to farmers may not lead to widespread CSA adoption, especially if farm-scale monitoring is required. Instead, landscape-scale approaches to C contracting, supported by satellite-based monitoring methods such as ours, could be a key strategy to reduce costs and uncertainty of C monitoring in heterogeneous smallholder landscapes, thereby incentivizing more widespread CSA adoption. © 2017","Aboveground biomass carbon; Ecosystem services; Landscape; Remote sensing; Smallholder agriculture; Uncertainty","carbon; aboveground biomass; adaptive management; agricultural land; carbon emission; climate change; credit provision; ecosystem service; emission inventory; farm size; mapping; prediction; remote sensing; satellite imagery; smallholder; spatial resolution; uncertainty analysis; agriculture; agroforestry; Article; climate; cropland; El Salvador; entropy; forest; land use; pasture; prediction; riparian ecosystem; rural area; satellite imagery; uncertainty; vegetation; agriculture; climate; climate change; ecosystem; environmental protection; uncertainty; El Salvador [Central America]; Agriculture; Carbon; Climate; Climate Change; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; El Salvador; Uncertainty","English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85025069504

Classification results and land use land cover change analysis show that 13.25% of agriculture-Kharif and 31.1% of vegetation was damaged. Crop Biomass was estimated with aid of crop conversion factor for pre- and post-cyclone conditions. Total ‘Above ground biomass’ of the agriculture crop area was estimated at 31.57 t/ha and total loss of biomass was assessed to be 4.2 t/ha. Carbon stock was found to be varying from 0.3 to 8.3 t.C/ha in specific agriculture crops. From the results, it was concluded that Hudhud has done significant damage to the rural and urban areas of Visakhapatnam. The outcome of this study can be used by decision-makers for the release of post disaster relief fund to affected areas. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","agriculture-specific crop biomass; crop carbon stock; economic loss of crops and remote sensing; land use land cover; Tropical cyclone","biomass; carbon; crop; economic impact; land cover; land use; Landsat; remote sensing; stock assessment; tropical cyclone","English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84961943240

Revegetation with halophytic shrub species such as Atriplex nummularia for carbon mitigation may be a viable option but to generate carbon credits ongoing monitoring and verification is required. This study investigated the utility of high-resolution airborne images (Digital Multi Spectral Imagery (DMSI)) obtained in two seasons to estimate carbon stocks at the plant- and stand-scale. Pixel-scale vegetation indices, sub-pixel fractional green vegetation cover for individual plants, and estimates of the fractional coverage of the grazing plants within entire plots, were extracted from the high-resolution images. Carbon stocks were correlated with both canopy coverage (R2: 0.76-0.89) and spectral-based vegetation indices (R2: 0.77-0.89) with or without the use of the near-infrared spectral band. Indices derived from the dry season image showed a stronger correlation with field measurements of carbon than those derived from the green season image. These results show that in semi-arid environments it is better to estimate saltbush biomass with remote sensing data in the dry season to exclude the effect of pasture, even without the refinement provided by a vegetation classification. The approach of using canopy cover to refine estimates of carbon yield has broader application in shrublands and woodlands. © 2017 by the authors.","Aboveground biomass; Atriplex nummularia; Carbon inventory; Carbon mitigation; Forage crops; Remote sensing; Vegetation index","Agriculture; Drought; Forestry; Pixels; Remote sensing; Revegetation; Soil conservation; Spectroscopy; Timing circuits; Above ground biomass; Atriplex nummularia; Carbon inventories; Carbon mitigation; Forage crops; Vegetation index; Vegetation","English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020275209

This paper investigates the 3D distribution of SOC to a depth of 1 m in a 4600-ha area in southeastern Iran with different land uses under the irrigated farming (IF), dry farming (DF), orchards (Or), range plants on the Gachsaran formation (RaG), and range plants on a quaternary formation (RaQ). Predictions were made using the artificial neural networks (ANNs), regression trees (RTs), and spline functions with auxiliary covariates derived from a digital elevation model (DEM), the Landsat 8 imagery, and land use types. Correlation analysis showed that the main predictors for SOC in the topsoil were covariates derived from the imagery; however, for the lower depths, covariates derived from both the DEM and imagery were important. ANNs showed more efficiency than did RTs in predicting SOC. The results showed that 3D distribution of SOC was significantly affected by land use types. SOC stocks of soils under Or and IF were significantly higher than those under DF, RaG, and RaQ. The SOC below 30 cm accounted for about 59% of the total soil stock. Results showed that depth functions combined with digital soil mapping techniques provide a promising approach to evaluate 3D SOC distribution under different land uses in semi-arid regions and could be used to assess changes in time to determine appropriate management strategies. © 2017, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Digital soil mapping; Soil carbon storage; Spatial distribution; Spline depth functions","Arid regions; Forestry; Land use; Mapping; Neural networks; Organic carbon; Soils; Spatial distribution; Correlation analysis; Different land use types; Digital elevation model; Digital soil mappings; Management strategies; Soil carbon storage; Soil organic carbon; Spline functions; Soil surveys; organic carbon; soil organic carbon; unclassified drug; carbon; soil; artificial neural network; digital elevation model; environmental impact assessment; environmental monitoring; land use; organic carbon; semiarid region; soil depth; soil organic matter; spatial analysis; three-dimensional modeling; agricultural worker; Article; artificial neural network; correlation analysis; correlation coefficient; Iran; land use; orchard; prediction; principal component analysis; regression tree; remote sensing; satellite imagery; semiarid climate; soil depth; spatial analysis; agriculture; chemistry; China; environmental monitoring; procedures; regression analysis; soil; theoretical model; validation study; Iran; Agriculture; Carbon; China; Environmental Monitoring; Iran; Models, Theoretical; Neural Networks (Computer); Regression Analysis; Soil","English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016642830

This study proposed a hybrid geostatistical method of extreme learning machine-ordinary kriging (ELMOK), to predict the spatial variability of the SOM content. To assess the feasibility of ELMOK, a case study was conducted in a regional scale study area in Shaanxi Province, China. A total of 472 topsoil (0-20 cm) samples were collected. A total of 14 auxiliary variables (predictors) were obtained from remote sensing data and environmental factors. The proposed method was compared with the ability of traditional geostatistical methods such as simple kriging (SK) and ordinary kriging (OK), in addition to hybrid geostatistical methods such as regression-ordinary kriging (ROK) and artificial neural network-ordinary kriging (ANNOK). The results showed that the extreme learning machines (ELM) model used principal components (PCs) as input variables, and performed better than both multiple linear regression (MLR) and artificial neural network (ANN) models. Compared with geostatistical and hybrid geostatistical prediction methods of SOM spatial distribution, the ELMOK model had the highest coefficient of determination (R2 = 0.671) and ratio of performance to deviation (RPD = 2.05), as well as the lowest root mean square error (RMSE = 1.402 g kg-1). In conclusion, the application of remote sensing imagery and environmental factors has a deeper driven significance of a non-linear and multi-dimensional hierarchy relationship for explaining the spatial variability of SOM, tracing local carbon sink and high quality SOM maps. More importantly, it is possibly concluded that the sustainable monitoring of SOM is a significant process through the pixel-based revisit sampling, an analysis of the mapping results of SOM, and methodological integration, which is the primary step in spatial variations and time series. The proposed ELMOK methodology is a promising and effective approach which can play a vital role in predicting the spatial variability of SOM at a regional scale. © 2017 by the authors.","Auxiliary variables; Extreme learning machine; Ordinary kriging; Soil organic matter; Spatial prediction","alternative agriculture; artificial neural network; carbon sink; environmental factor; kriging; machine learning; numerical model; remote sensing; satellite imagery; soil organic matter; spatial distribution; spatial variation; topsoil; China; Shaanxi","English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019153055

Increasing the atmospheric temperature resulting from absorption of certain gases due to solar energy leads to the Green house effect. Gases, such as Carbon dioxide (CO2), Water vapors, Nitrous Oxide (N2O), Ozone (O3) and Methane (CH4) which capture solar energy and radiated by the earth's Surface. CO2is one of chief green house gas. Rising the carbon dioxide levels continuously, warming atmosphere resulting from rising sea levels, agriculture disruptions, and stronger storms. To reduce the amount of Carbon dioxide in atmosphere Carbon Sequestration is needed. Carbon Sequestration is the process of capture and long-term storage of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2). Storing the carbon dioxide in plants and soil (Terrestrial Sequestration), Underground (Geological Sequestration) and Deep in Ocean (Ocean Sequestration). Terrestrial or biologic sequestration is process of atmospheric carbon dioxide is stored as carbon in the stems and roots of plants and also in soil. Estimating the amount of forest biomass is very crucial for monitoring and estimating the amount of carbon that is lost or emitted during deforestation, and it will also give an idea of the forest potential to sequester and store carbon in the forest ecosystem. Estimations of forest carbon stocks are based upon the estimation of forest biomass. Whereas Geological and Ocean Sequestration are the storing the carbon dioxide in large tunnels. Remote Sensing (RS) and Geographic Information System (GIS) had great potential in current estimation, future prediction and management of Terrestrial carbon sequestration. In climate change mitigation, this approach can provide an efficient and cost - effective means of estimating above and below ground biomass, delineating spatial variability, predicting potential carbon stocks and revenues and outlining appropriate management strategies for localized and regional scale. In future, the deployment of an integrating RS-GIS approach for precision carbon management will become more visible.

Reflectance measurements have been successfully used to predict soil organic carbon (OC) content of agricultural soils, measured in the laboratory on samples of dried soil or directly in the field using field spectro-radiometer or satellite imagery. This study proposes a method for spatial prediction of soil OC, from UAV imagery. An agricultural plot of 13 ha &quot;Grande Borne&quot; located in the plain of Versailles (78) was analysed in April 2013, shortly before sowing while it was still bare soil. The AIRINOV&#174; UAV used was equipped with a four channels multispectral camera MultiSPEC 4C&#174; (550nm, 660nm, 735 nm and 790 nm) and flying at an altitude of 150m. Twenty three ground control points, distributed in the plot were delineated by target located with a centimetric DGPS and different measures have been made synchronously with the drone flight: Spectral Measurements (spectroradiometer ASD FieldSpec 3&#174;), roughness measurements by photogrammetric method, samples of soil samples for analysis of chemical composition and water content. The images obtained with a resolution of 15cm have been georeferenced with an infra-pixel accuracy. The field spectra were aggregated on the spectral bands of the Multispec 4C for validation by linear regression. The obtained R2, between 0.8 and 0.9 by band, with an error between 1 and 3[%], have shown good reliability of the Multispec 4C&#174; sensor. The OC content was then estimated by partial least squares regression (PLSR) from spectral measurements of the 23 plots. The mean squared error of cross validation (RMSECV) by LOO (Leave One Out) method was 1.97 g of OC per kg of soil. A second correction of the model incorporating the effects of moisture and roughness on reflectance, has improved the quality of the prediction by 18[%] and a RMSECV of 1.61 g/kg. The model was finally spatialized in GIS and compared to simple spatial interpolations of soil analyses.",,"Agriculture; Chemical analysis; Drones; Forecasting; Least squares approximations; Mean square error; Organic carbon; Radiometers; Reflection; Remote sensing; Rock mechanics; Satellite imagery; Soils; Sols; Analysis of chemical composition; Ground control points; Multi-spectral cameras; Organic carbon contents; Partial least squares regressions (PLSR); Spatial interpolation; Spectral measurement; Spectro-radiometers; Soil surveys","English; French",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85015658742

Leaf chlorophyll content of the crop can help to obtain information about the physiological status of the plant and it can help in studying of the carbon balance and responses to fertilizer (e.g., nitrogen) application.

Mathematical models for wheat crop chlorophyll content are created based on the collected data and a supervised Artificial Neural Network algorithm. The created mathematical models are used to investigate the status of the winter wheat crop throughout Lebanon using remote sensing data. The verification of the results is based on the collected LCC measurements using a chlorophyll meter during the same time a remote sensing satellite is imaging the study area.

Particularly, tropical deforestation is a major driver of biodiversity decline and substantial carbon emissions. Regrowth of secondary vegetation may help to restore habitat for many threatened species and improve ecosystem services that deteriorated due to deforestation. However, spatial-temporal patterns of regrowing secondary vegetation in the tropics remain weakly understood. We therefore analyze regrowth dynamics across two different land use systems in southern Amazonia: the extensive pastoralism in Pará and the capital-intensive agriculture in Mato Grosso. Both systems are connected by the BR-163 highway, which represents a major axis of deforestation and agricultural development in the Brazilian Amazon since decades. We used a 29 year time series of Landsat images to extract regrowth extent, duration, lag time between deforestation and regrowth, and frequency of regrowth cycles. Our results reached an overall accuracy of 89% and showed regrowth on up to 50% of the deforested area in Pará and a maximum of 25% in Mato Grosso. In both states, annual regrowth rates drastically dropped after 1996, which coincided with socio-economic transformations and drought events. The majority of regrowth was concentrated within 60 m distance to forest edges and cleared again after an average of 5 years. Our approach bears great potential for mapping post deforestation regrowth dynamics within and beyond the Brazilian Amazon based on long-term and freely accessible remote sensing data collections, such as the Landsat and the forthcoming Sentinel-2 archives. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","Image compositing; Landsat; Regrowth dynamics; Secondary vegetation; Time series; Tropical forests","Biodiversity; Conservation; Dynamics; Ecosystems; Image processing; Land use; Remote sensing; Time series; Tropics; Vegetation; Agricultural development; Image compositing; LANDSAT; Remote sensing data; Secondary vegetation; Socio-economic transformations; Tropical deforestation; Tropical forest; Deforestation; agricultural development; biodiversity; carbon emission; deforestation; ecosystem service; endangered species; forest edge; habitat restoration; land use; Landsat; pastoralism; regrowth; secondary production; Sentinel; socioeconomic conditions; time series analysis; tropical forest; Amazonas [Brazil]; Brazil; Mato Grosso; Para [Brazil]","English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-84990224835

The aim of this study was to investigate the potential of UAS (Unmanned Aerial Systems) multi-spectral imagery (480-1000 nm) for estimating the SOC content in bare cultivated soils at a high spatial resolution (12 cm). We performed UAS analysis on the Hoosfield Spring Barley experiment at Rothamsted (UK) where adjacent plots with distinctly different SOC contents, due to different long-term management practices, provide a valuable resource to evaluate this approach. We acquired images (wavelength: 480-550-670-780-880-1000 nm) at an altitude of 120 m over an area of 2 ha using a multi-spectral camera mounted on an UAS. The high-resolution images captured small-scale variations at the soil surface (e.g. shadows, tillage and wheels marks). After a projection in new dimensions by a PCA, we calibrated a support vector machine regression using observations from conventional soil sampling and SOC measurements.

This paper addresses the role of SOC as a component of a common functional unit in soil from analysis within a single field and over multiple fields. Soil data measured on the fields during the SMAPVEX12 satellite prelaunch algorithm development campaign exhibited high correlation among SOC, field-mean soil water content (SWC), bulk density, and soil texture. The analysis extended over a wide range of soil texture and wetness in the top 5 cm of soil over 50 agricultural fields covering ~400 km2 of southern Manitoba. Data collected over a much smaller area from Ontario silt loam soils at the Elora Research Centre demonstrated a similar correlation between SOC and SWC in intensive field sampling. This intercorrelation of SOC and SWC is examined with partial least-squares regression, principal component analysis, and geostatistical semivariograms. A model is proposed to interpret the feedback process between SOC and SWC to explain the persistent correlation. Further work to substantiate the strengths and limits of the relationship between SOC and SWC may be beneficial for estimating SWC for remote sensing, agriculture, hydrology, and ecosystem function. © 2016, Canadian Journal of Soil Science.

Arg) is a major driving force for deforestation and forest degradation in mountainous South-East Asia. In China, the unclear distinction between natural forest and commercial plantations has permitted the expansion of rubber into protected forest areas of nature reserves. However, the impact of such land-use changes on landscape carbon balances within nature reserves has rarely been investigated. We selected the Naban River Watershed National Nature Reserve (NRWNNR) in Xishuangbanna, China as a case study area and evaluated carbon stocks using the Rapid Carbon Stock Appraisal (RaCSA) method based on tree, plot, land use and landscape assessments, integrating field sampling with remote sensing and GIS technology. Six dominant land use systems were surveyed: lowland forest (&lt;800 m above sea level), highland forest (&gt;800 m a.s.l.), lowland rubber, highland rubber, bush and grassland and agricultural crops. Land use type-specific time-averaged carbon stocks (Cta) were calculated based on total above ground biomass (AGB). Soil organic carbon (surface 30 cm) and below ground biomass were measured, but not included in Cta calculations due to large uncertainties unrelated to land use change. The Cta of lowland and highland rubber plantations were 58 Mg C ha-1 and 28 Mg C ha-1 respectively, showing larger carbon sequestration potential than nonforest land use types (agricultural crops, bush and grassland) but much lower than Cta of natural forest (156-185 Mg C ha-1). Sensitivity analysis of Cta variability showed that forest C stocks have the largest influence on landscape carbon balance. Time series analysis of land-use and land-cover maps (1989, 2007, 2012) demonstrated that during 23 years, the whole landscape of the nature reserve (26,574 ha) gained 0.644 Tg C. Despite rubber expansion, biosphere zoning strategy (i.e. experimental, buffer, core zones), and reforestation activities conducted in NRWNNR were able to enhance the carbon stocks. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon sequestration; Mosaic agricultural landscape; Rapid Carbon Stock Appraisal; Rubber plantations; Time-averaged carbon stocks","Agriculture; Biospherics; Crops; Deforestation; Forestry; Geographic information systems; Organic carbon; Reforestation; Remote sensing; Rubber; Rubber plantations; Sea level; Sensitivity analysis; Time series analysis; Agricultural landscapes; Carbon sequestration; Carbon sequestration potential; Carbon stocks; Commercial plantation; Land use and land cover; Landscape assessments; Remote sensing and GIS; Land use; belowground biomass; biogeochemical cycle; carbon flux; carbon sequestration; evergreen tree; grassland; land use change; organic carbon; plantation; range expansion; reforestation; remote sensing; rubber; zoning; China; Naban River; Xishuangbanna; Yunnan; Hevea brasiliensis","English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84962860043

Since 1980, net carbon emissions from LULCC in Asia were responsible for 20%-40% of global LULCC emissions, with emissions from Southeast Asia alone accounting for 15%-25% of global LULCC emissions during the same period. In the 2000s and for all Asia, three estimates (FAO-FRA, DGVM, Houghton) were in agreement of a net source of carbon to the atmosphere, with mean estimates ranging between 0.24 to 0.41 Pg C yr-1, whereas EDGARv4.3 suggested a net carbon sink of -0.17 Pg C yr-1. Three of 4 estimates suggest that LULCC carbon emissions declined by at least 34% in the preceding decade (1990-2000). Spread in the estimates is due to the inclusion of different flux components and their treatments, showing the importance to include emissions from carbon rich peatlands and land management, such as shifting cultivation and wood harvesting, which appear to be consistently underreported. © 2016 IOP Publishing Ltd.","deforestation; DGVM,carbon budget; Land use change","Agriculture; Budget control; Cultivation; Deforestation; Forestry; Remote sensing; Carbon budgets; Food and agriculture organizations; Forest resource assessments; Land use and land cover change; Land-use change; Multiple data sources; Remote sensing techniques; Shifting cultivations; Land use; atmosphere-biosphere interaction; carbon emission; carbon flux; carbon sink; deforestation; Food and Agricultural Organization; land cover; land management; land use change; peatland; regional climate; remote sensing; Southeast Asia","English",Review,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84980028613

In this paper, MODIS remote sensing vegetation greenness from the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and evapotranspiration (ET) data for the 2000-2012 period were analyzed to understand the differences in the net primary productivity (NPP-proxy), carbon, and the evaporative flux of the major Cerrado natural and anthropic landscapes. The understanding of the carbon and evaporative fluxes of the main natural and anthropic vegetation types is of fundamental importance in studies regarding the impacts of land cover and land use changes in the regional and global climate. The seasonal dynamics of EVI and ET of the main natural and anthropic vegetation types of the Cerrado biome were analyzed using a total of 35 satellite-based samples distributed over representative Cerrado landscapes. Carbon and water fluxes were estimated for different scenarios, such as, a hypothetical unconverted Cerrado, 2002 and 2050 scenarios based on values derived from literature and on the PROBIO land cover and land use map for the Cerrado. The total growing season biomass for 2002 in the Cerrado region was estimated to be 28 gigatons of carbon and the evapotranspiration was 1336 gigatons of water. The mean estimated growing season evapotranspiration and biomass for 2002 was 576 Gt of water and 12 Gt of carbon for pasture and croplands compared to 760 Gt of water and 15 Gt of carbon for the Cerrado natural vegetation. In a modeled future scenario for the year 2050, the ET flux from natural Cerrado vegetation was 394 Gt less than in 2002 and 991 Gt less than in an unconverted scenario, with only natural vegetation, while the carbon was 8 Gt less than in 2002 and 21 Gt less than in this hypothetical pre-conversion Cerrado. On the other hand, the sum of the pasture and cropland ET flux increased by 405 Gt in 2050 relative to 2002 and the carbon by 11 Gt of carbon. Given the increasing global demand for agricultural products and the insufficient protected areas in the Cerrado (with a significant area of remaining native vegetation in privately owned lands that may be legally deforested), our analyses suggest that potential future changes to the water and carbon balances are likely to be highly significant in the severely threatened Cerrado biome. On the other hand, our results also suggest that the recovery of degraded pastures can have a positive impact on climate, due to the higher rates of carbon sequestration and water transfer to the atmosphere. © 2016 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

The region covers an area of 1,395,975 ha. We used images made by the Operational Land Imager (OLI) sensor (OLI/Landsat-8) to produce mappings, and image segmentation techniques to produce vectors with homogeneous characteristics. The training samples and the samples used for classification and validation were collected from the segmented image. To quantify the C stocked in aboveground live biomass (AGLB), we used an indirect method and applied literature-based reference values. The recovery of 205,690 ha of a secondary Native Forest (NF) after 1985 sequestered 9.7 Tg (Teragram) of C. Considering the whole NF area (455,232 ha), the amount of C accumulated along the whole watershed was 35.5 Tg, and the whole Eucalyptus crop (EU) area (113,600 ha) sequestered 4.4 Tg of C. Thus, the total amount of C sequestered in the whole watershed (NF + EU) was 39.9 Tg of C or 145.6 Tg of CO2, and the NF areas were responsible for the largest C stock at the watershed (89%). Therefore, the increase of the NF cover contributes positively to the reduction of CO2 concentration in the atmosphere, and Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) may become one of the most promising compensation mechanisms for the farmers who increased forest cover at their farms. © 2016 SPIE.","Eucalyptus; Forestry dynamics; Native forest; Paraíba do Sul River watershed; Remote sensing","Agriculture; Carbon dioxide; Deforestation; Ecology; Ecosystems; Hydrology; Image segmentation; Land use; Remote sensing; Secondary recovery; Timber; Watersheds; Aboveground live biomass; Compensation mechanism; Eucalyptus; Land use and land cover change; Native forests; Operational land imager; River watersheds; Segmentation techniques; Forestry","English",Conference Paper,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85011110643

In this study, visible-near infrared reflectance spectroscopy was evaluated for rapid prediction of soil organic carbon (SOC) contents in soils of the Indo-Gangetic alluvial Plains of Punjab, India. A total of 800 surface soil samples (480 for calibration and 320 for validation) from farmers’ field representing the districts of Ludhiana, Moga, Gurdaspur and Bhatinda in Punjab State, India were collected, ensuring sufficient variation in SOC content. Reflectance spectra were obtained from air-dried samples (&lt;2 mm size) under controlled laboratory conditions using a hyperspectral ASD FieldSpecPro spectroradiometer. Part of the same samples was used for SOC determination by Walkley and Black titration method. The SOC value in the study area varies from 4.0 to 18.1 g kg−1 (mean 7.9 g kg−1 and standard deviation of 2.2 g kg−1) among the soil samples. Partial least squares regression technique was employed to examine the relationships between SOC and the reflectance spectra; and to identify the wavelengths sensitive to SOC variation. Among 15 spectral transformations used for calibration, SGF-2-3 transformation (transformation to 1st derivative with second order polynomial smoothing with 3 points using Savitzky-Golay filter) was the best for SOC modeling in the IGP soils as it showed highest validation r2 (0.81) and RPD (2.30) and the lowest RMSEP (0.116) with 6 PLS factors.

Identifying and addressing the causes or drivers of anthropogenic forest change is considered crucial for global climate change mitigation. Few countries however, monitor deforestation drivers in a systematic manner. National-level quantitative spatially explicit information on drivers is often lacking. This study quantifies proximate drivers of deforestation and related carbon losses in South America based on remote sensing time series in a systematic, spatially explicit manner. Deforestation areas were derived from the 2010 global remote sensing survey of the Food and Agricultural Organisation Forest Resource Assessment. To assess proximate drivers, land use following deforestation was assigned by visual interpretation of high-resolution satellite imagery. To estimate gross carbon losses from deforestation, default Tier 1 biomass levels per country and eco-zone were used. Pasture was the dominant driver of forest area (71.2%) and related carbon loss (71.6%) in South America, followed by commercial cropland (14% and 12.1% respectively). Hotspots of deforestation due to pasture occurred in Northern Argentina, Western Paraguay, and along the arc of deforestation in Brazil where they gradually moved into higher biomass forests causing additional carbon losses. Deforestation driven by commercial cropland increased in time, with hotspots occurring in Brazil (Mato Grosso State), Northern Argentina, Eastern Paraguay and Central Bolivia. Infrastructure, such as urban expansion and roads, contributed little as proximate drivers of forest area loss (1.7%). Our findings contribute to the understanding of drivers of deforestation and related carbon losses in South America, and are comparable at the national, regional and continental level. In addition, they support the development of national REDD+ interventions and forest monitoring systems, and provide valuable input for statistical analysis and modelling of underlying drivers of deforestation. © 2015 IOP Publishing Ltd.","deforestation; forest carbon loss; land use; proximate causes; REDD+; remote sensing; South America","Agriculture; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Deforestation; Land use; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Forest carbons; Forest monitoring systems; Forest resource assessments; Global climate changes; High resolution satellite imagery; Proximate cause; REDD; South America; Forestry; anthropogenic effect; carbon emission; climate change; deforestation; land use change; remote sensing; satellite imagery; South America","English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-84952933740

Total livestock feed intake in 2011 was 2.42 ± 0.21 Pg C yr-1, of which 2.31 ± 0.21 Pg C yr-1 was emitted as CO2, 0.07 ± 0.01 Pg C yr-1 was emitted as CH4, and 0.04 Pg C yr-1 was contained within milk and egg production.

Especially in the tropics where forests are declining at a rapid rate, national forest monitoring systems capable of reliably estimating forest cover, forest cover change and carbon stock change are of vital importance. As a large number of tropical countries had limited capacity in the past to implement such a system, capacity building efforts are now ongoing to strengthen the technical and political skillsets necessary to implement national forest monitoring at institutional levels. This paper assesses the current status and recent changes in national forest monitoring and reporting capacities in 99 tropical countries, using the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) Forest Resources Assessment (FRA) 2015 data, complemented with FRA 2010 and FRA 2005 data. Three indicators ""Forest area change monitoring and remote sensing capacities"", ""Forest inventory capacities"" and ""Carbon pool reporting capacities"" were used to assess the countries' capacities for the years 2005, 2010 and 2015 and the change in capacities between 2005-2010 and 2010-2015. Forest area change monitoring and remote sensing capacities improved considerably between 2005 and 2015. The total tropical forest area that is monitored with good to very good forest area change monitoring and remote sensing capacities increased from 69% in 2005 to 83% in 2015. This corresponds to 1435. million. ha in 2005 and 1699. million. ha in 2015. This effect is related to more free and open remote sensing data and availability of techniques to improve forest area change monitoring. The total tropical forest area that is monitored with good to very good forest inventory capacities increased from 38% in 2005 to 66% in 2015. This corresponds to 785. million. ha in 2005 and 1350. million. ha in 2015. Carbon pool reporting capacities did not show as much improvement and the majority of countries still report at Tier 1 level. This indicates the need for greater emphasis on producing accurate emission factors at Tier 2 or Tier 3 level and improved greenhouse gases reporting. It is further shown that there was a positive adjustment in the net change in forest area where countries with lower capacities in the past had the tendency to overestimate the area of forest loss. The results emphasized the effectiveness of capacity building programmes (such as those by FAO and REDD+ readiness) but also the need for continued capacity development efforts. It is important for countries to maintain their forest monitoring system and update their inventories on a regular basis. This will further improve accuracy and reliability of data and information on forest resources and will provide countries with the necessary input to refine policies and decisions and to further improve forest management. © 2015.","Capacity building; Carbon reporting; Forest cover change; Monitoring systems; REDD+; Tropical forests","Greenhouse gases; Information management; Inventory control; Monitoring; Natural resources; Remote sensing; Tropics; Capacity building; Carbon reporting; Forest cover change; Monitoring system; REDD; Tropical forest; Forestry; carbon sink; emission inventory; environmental monitoring; Food and Agricultural Organization; forest cover; forest inventory; forest management; forest resource; greenhouse gas; monitoring system; remote sensing; tropical forest; United Nations; Forestry; Indicators; Information Retrieval; Remote Sensing; Tropical Atmospheres","English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-84941050373

Although surface roughness, vegetation and soil texture have been established as sources of variability in passive microwave interpretation, soil organic carbon (SOC) has not typically been considered as a factor that affects SWC estimation during field sampling campaigns. SOC was observed along with soil texture and bulk density during the Soil Moisture Active Passive Validation Experiment in 2012 (SMAPVEX12), the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite algorithm development field sampling campaign held June 6 to July 19 in Southern Manitoba, Canada. Aerial measurements from the PALS (Passive Active L-band System) instrument were recorded over agricultural fields and forest areas from aircraft while SWC was measured simultaneously on the ground with resistance probes on 17 sampling dates. Additionally, fields were sampled for surface roughness, vegetation growth and water content, soil and vegetation temperature and soil physical characteristics. A soil core was collected on each field each sampling time to assess bulk density, soil particle size and SOC. SOC accounted for more variability in the anomalies between PALS and ground sampled SWC than sand, clay or bulk density, although all soil variables explained significant variability. With analysis by partial least squares multiple regression over 11 sampling dates and 39 fields where both ground and PALS data were well represented, only SOC contributed significantly to the regression of SWC beyond the variance all soil variables had in common. The significance of SOC in the relative SWC anomalies was highest in very wet and very dry conditions and in loam soil over all sampling dates, while bulk density was more significant in sand soils. This analysis suggests SOC is a simple variable that incorporates multiple aspects of soil hydrology and may improve the algorithms for remotely sensing estimation of SWC in various landscapes. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Brightness temperature; Passive microwave remote sensing; SMAP satellite; Soil dielectric constant; Soil organic carbon; Soil water content","Agriculture; Antennas; Fighter aircraft; Hydrology; Least squares approximations; Moisture; Organic carbon; Particle size; Remote sensing; Soil moisture; Surface roughness; Vegetation; Weather forecasting; Brightness temperatures; Passive microwave remote sensing; Soil dielectric constant; Soil organic carbon; Soil water content; Soils","English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84975857213

Knowing what soil parameters have the greatest influence on bare soil imagery will facilitate better use of remote sensing for precision crop management. The objectives of this study were (i) to determine measured soil properties that are most influential on remotely sensed bare soil reflectance and (ii) to select which spectral band or combination of spectral bands is best for describing individual soil properties. This study was conducted on three study sites located in northeastern Colorado. All sites were in irrigated continuous corn (Zea mays L.) cropping systems. Remotely sensed imagery was acquired by aircraft prior to planting. Soil samples were collected and analyzed for bulk density, soil color (moist and dry), organic matter, organic carbon, soil texture, and cone index. Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed for the green, red, and near-infrared (NIR) bands of the imagery. Least-squares regression analysis was used for analyzing relationships between remote sensing data and soil data. Across study sites, the first principal components of the green, red, and NIR bands were found to have significant statistical relationships with organic carbon and sand, silt, and clay fractions. Individual spectral bands explained a significant portion of the variability in soil moisture, moist soil color, dry soil color, organic carbon, sand, silt, and clay.

In this laboratory-based work we demonstrate the capabilities of the thermal infrared between 8 and 14. μm (longwave infrared) to detect and quantify small ranges of the soil properties sand-, clay, and soil organic carbon (SOC) content, as they appear in the semi-arid agricultural landscapes of the Mullewa region in Western Australia.

The effects of human activities on land use and the related environmental changes were investigated through point and areal studies surrounding Meiliang Bay, which is an open area of extreme eutrophication in Taihu Lake, China. This study used remote sensing and environmental-tracer profiles [total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), total organic carbon (TOC), grain size, and geochemical parameters] to determine the causes of changes in land use and the associated environmental parameters. The results of LUCCs (Land use/cover changes) indicate that over the past three decades, total farmland decreased by 862.49 km2, with an annual decrement rate of 28.75 km2/year, and total urbanized land increased by 859.71 km2, with an annual growth rate of 28.66 km2/year. The geochemical results indicate that the trophic state of Taihu Lake was persistently intensifying and that the TN, TP, and TOC concentrations increased twofold, threefold, and twofold, respectively, from 1949 to 2010. The sources of TN, TP, and TOC were highly similar after 1975. However, before 1974, TN and TP originated from different sources than TOC. The grassland and woodland around the lake retain nutrients and sand from the land of study area.

Frequent reclamation of wetlands and grasslands and intensive agricultural activity have induced significant changes in both land use/cover and soil physicochemical properties in the riparian zones of the middle Heihe River basin of China. The present study aims to explore whether land use/land cover change (LUCC) can well explain the variations in soil properties in the riparian zones of the middle Heihe River basin. To achieve this, we mapped LUCC and quantified the type of land use change using remote sensing images, topographic maps, and GIS analysis techniques. Forty-two sites were selected for soil and vegetation sampling. Then, physical and chemical experiments were employed to determine soil moisture, soil bulk density, soil pH, soil organic carbon, total nitrogen, total potassium, total phosphorous, available nitrogen, available potassium, and available phosphorous. The Independent-Samples Kruskal-Wallis Test, principal component analysis, and a scatter matrix were used to analyze the effects of LUCC on soil properties. The results indicate that the majority of the parameters investigated were affected significantly by LUCC. In particular, soil moisture and soil organic carbon can be explained well by land cover change and land use change, respectively. Furthermore, changes in soil moisture could be attributed primarily to land cover changes. Changes in soil organic carbon were correlated closely with the following land use change types: wetlands-arable, forest-grasslands, and grasslands-desert. Other parameters, including pH and total K, were also found to exhibit significant correlations with LUCC. However, changes in soil nutrients were shown to be induced most probably by human agricultural activity (i.e. fertilize, irrigation, tillage, etc.), rather than by simple conversions from one land use/cover types to the others. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Arid inland basin; Heihe river; Land use/land cover change; Soil properties","Forestry; Land reclamation; Land use; Maps; Nitrogen; Organic carbon; Phosphorus; Potassium; Principal component analysis; Remote sensing; Rivers; Soil moisture; Watersheds; Wetlands; Agricultural activities; Arid inland basin; Heihe river; Land use and land cover; Land use/land cover change; Remote sensing images; Soil physico-chemical properties; Soil property; Soil testing; nitrogen; organic carbon; phosphorus; potassium; nitrogen; phosphorus; soil; land cover; land use change; oasis; organic carbon; principal component analysis; remote sensing; riparian zone; satellite data; satellite imagery; soil moisture; soil organic matter; vegetation dynamics; arable land; Article; bulk density; China; correlation analysis; desert; environmental impact assessment; environmental parameters; forest; geographic information system; grassland; irrigation (agriculture); Kruskal Wallis test; land use; land use land cover change; physical chemistry; principal component analysis; quantitative analysis; remote sensing; riparian ecosystem; river basin; soil acidity; soil analysis; soil fertilization; soil moisture; soil property; tillage; topography; vegetation; wetland; agriculture; chemistry; desert climate; ecosystem; environment; environmental monitoring; environmental protection; procedures; remote sensing; river; soil; trends; urbanization; China; Gansu; Heihe Basin; Agriculture; China; Conservation of Natural Resources; Desert Climate; Ecosystem; Environment; Environmental Monitoring; Nitrogen; Phosphorus; Remote Sensing Technology; Rivers; Soil; Urbanization","English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84911377136

In recent years, human activities such as drainage for agriculture have devastated tropical peatland, which causes severe emission of greenhouse gases and lowering of the land surface (subsidence). Necessity to observe subsidence behaviors over time in a large scale is increasing since subsidence data is one of the important parameters for assessments of carbon losses from drained peatland. Although many efforts to calculate the subsidence on tropical peatland by remote sensing system have been done, few studies on InSAR time-series analyses have been reported. In this research, long-term subsidence in Jambi, Indonesia was analyzed by means of PS-InSAR technique with the aim to estimate the greenhouse gases from peatland. Firstly, PALSAR data in ascending and descending orbit was processed respectively to map the subsidence distribution. Secondly, these results derived from different orbit were merged together to obtain the vertical component of subsidence (2.5-D surface deformation method). Finally, the subsidence was related to the groundwater table to investigate their relationships. It is expected that the adoption of both ascending and descending data enhances the reliability of the estimation, which gives us better understanding of subsidence phenomenon and peatland condition.","Carbon emission; PALSAR; Peatland; PS-InSAR","Greenhouse gases; Groundwater; Remote sensing; Time series analysis; Wetlands; Carbon emissions; Dimensional analysis; Ground water table; PALSAR; Peatland; PS-InSAR; Remote sensing system; Vertical component; Subsidence","English",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84964001393

Forest vegetation characteristics, including land cover and phenology, affect processes such as water cycle, absorption and re-emission of solar radiation, momentum transfer, carbon cycle, and latent and sensible heat fluxes. The climate system responds in complex ways to changes in forcing that may be natural or human-induced. Drastic climate change over the last decades has greatly increased the importance of forest land cover changes monitoring through time-series satellite data. Satellite based derived biophysical parameters for assessment of climate impacts on forest vegetation have to meet particularly high quality requirements.

However, extrapolating site-scale observations to regional scales represents a major challenge confronting the agricultural modeling community. This study introduces a novel geospatial agricultural modeling system (GAMS) exploring the integration of the mechanistic Environmental Policy Integrated Climate model, spatially-resolved data, surveyed management data, and supercomputing functions for cropland C budgets estimates. This modeling system creates spatially-explicit modeling units at a spatial resolution consistent with remotely-sensed crop identification and assigns cropping systems to each of them by geo-referencing surveyed crop management information at the county or state level. A parallel computing algorithm was also developed to facilitate the computationally intensive model runs and output post-processing and visualization. We evaluated GAMS against National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) reported crop yields and inventory estimated county-scale cropland C budgets averaged over 2000-2008. We observed good overall agreement, with spatial correlation of 0.89, 0.90, 0.41, and 0.87, for crop yields, Net Primary Production (NPP), Soil Organic C (SOC) change, and Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE), respectively. However, we also detected notable differences in the magnitude of NPP and NEE, as well as in the spatial pattern of SOC change. By performing crop-specific annual comparisons, we discuss possible explanations for the discrepancies between GAMS and the inventory method, such as data requirements, representation of agroecosystem processes, completeness and accuracy of crop management data, and accuracy of crop area representation. Based on these analyses, we further discuss strategies to improve GAMS by updating input data and by designing more efficient parallel computing capability to quantitatively assess errors associated with the simulation of C budget components. The modularized design of the GAMS makes it flexible to be updated and adapted for different agricultural models so long as they require similar input data, and to be linked with socio-economic models to understand the effectiveness and implications of diverse C management practices and policies. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Agriculture; Carbon; Climate change; EPIC; Geospatial modeling; Parallel computing","Agriculture; Budget control; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Climate models; Crops; Economics; Ecosystems; Environmental protection; Input output programs; Parallel architectures; Parallel processing systems; Surveys; Accurate quantifications; Environmental policy integrated climate models; EPIC; Geospatial model; National agricultural statistics services; Net primary production; Parallel computing algorithms; Spatially-explicit models; Information management; agricultural land; agricultural land; algorithm; carbon budget; carbon budget; carbon dioxide; climate modeling; concentration (composition); crop yield; crop yield; environmental policy; environmental policy; error analysis; error analysis; estimation method; forest inventory; regional pattern; regional pattern; remote sensing; remote sensing; simulation; statistical analysis","English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84908663986

Despite the wide recognition of the importance of these services, drivers of soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics across various land uses in East Africa are poorly understood. The objectives of this study were threefold: to quantify SOC stocks across Tanzania; assess the effect of land cover and erosion on SOC; and investigate the relationship between inherent and dynamic soil properties under diverse land uses. The Land Degradation Surveillance Framework (LDSF) was used to assess the variability of ecological metrics at different spatial scales. SOC was quantified within and between different land cover types (forest, woodland, shrubland, grassland and cropland) in Tanzania. A total of 2052 soil samples from 1082-1000m2 plots were collected from seven 100-km2 sentinel sites in 2010. Composite soil samples were collected at each plot from two depths (0-20 and 20-50cm) and cumulative soil mass samples were collected to 100cm. Soil samples were analyzed using a combination of traditional analytical laboratory methods and mid-infrared spectroscopy (MIR). Model performance of MIR spectral predictions for carbon was good, with an R2 of &gt;0.95 and RMSEP of 4.3gkg-1, when using an independent validation datasets. Woodland and cropland were the most frequently occurring vegetation structure types in the sampled sites, with 388 and 246 plots, respectively. Average topsoil OC (and range) was 12.4 (1.5-81.4) gCkg-1 (n=1082) and average subsoil OC (and range) was 7.3 (0.64-53.8) gCkg-1 (n=970) for the seven sites. Forested plots had the highest mean topsoil organic carbon concentrations (17.3gCkg-1) followed by cropland (13.3gCkg-1), for all sites included in the study, but with high levels of variability between sites. Soil mass at 30cm was measured and these data were used to calculate carbon stocks for the different land cover types. An approach based on remote sensing was explored for the mapping of SOC stocks at 30cm for Tanzania using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) imagery from 2012. Results indicate that the use of image reflectance for the mapping of SOC stocks has promising potential, with R2 values ranging from 0.77 to 0.81 and RMSEP values from 0.90 to 1.03kgm-2 for the three validation datasets. There is high utility of these maps for strategic land management interventions that prioritize ecosystem services. © 2015.","Erosion prevalence; Remote sensing; SOC stocks; Spatial scales; Spectroscopy","Agriculture; Carbon; Climate change; Ecology; Ecosystems; Erosion; Forestry; Image reconstruction; Infrared spectroscopy; Laboratories; Land use; Mapping; Organic carbon; Radiometers; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Soil surveys; Spectroscopy; Agricultural productions; Analytical laboratories; Dynamic soil properties; Mid-infrared spectroscopy; Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer; SOC stocks; Soil carbon sequestration; Spatial scale; Soils; climate change; concentration (composition); ecosystem service; hydrological cycle; land cover; land degradation; land use; MODIS; organic carbon; remote sensing; soil organic matter; spatial analysis; subsoil; topsoil; vegetation structure; East Africa; Tanzania","English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-84946472291

It provides various valuable subsistence products to local farmers, mostly the poor ethnic minority groups. Controversially, it is also closely connected with a number of environmental issues. With the strengthening regional economic cooperation in SEA, swidden agriculture has experienced drastic transformations into other diverse market-oriented land use types since the 1990s. However, there is very limited information on the basic geographical and demographic data of swidden agriculture and the socio-economic and biophysical effects of the transformations. International programs, such as the Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD), underscore the importance of monitoring and evaluating swidden agriculture and its transition to reduce carbon emission due to deforestation and forest degradation. In this context, along with the accessibility of Landsat historical imagery, remote sensing based techniques will offer an effective way to detect and monitor the locations and extent of swidden agriculture. Many approaches for investigating fire occurrence and burned area can be introduced for swidden agriculture mapping due to the common feature of fire relatedness. In this review paper, four broad approaches involving spectral signatures, phenological characteristics, statistical theory and landscape ecology were summarized for swidden agriculture delineation. Five research priorities about swidden agriculture involving remote sensing techniques, spatial pattern, change, drivers and impacts were proposed accordingly. To our knowledge, a synthesis review on the remote sensing and outlook on swidden agriculture has not been reported yet. This review paper aims to give a comprehensive overview of swidden agriculture studies in the domains of debated definition, trends, remote sensing methods and outlook research in SEA undertaken in the past two decades.©2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Drivers; Fire-related; Impacts; REDD; Remote sensing; Review; Southeast Asia (SEA); Swidden agriculture","Environmental issues; Fire-related; Impacts; International program; REDD; Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD); Remote sensing techniques; Southeast Asia; Deforestation; Economics; Land use; Regional planning; Remote sensing; Reviews; Truck drivers; Agriculture; Agriculture; Deforestation; Economics; Land Use; Remote Sensing","English",Review,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-84896847469

Net primary productivity (NPP) provides the inputs of C in ecosystems that can potentially be sequestered in soil organic matter. In this study, we estimates the C density and accumulation rate in rice-wheat agroecosystem at four sites of Indo-Gangetic Plains and Vindhyan highlands through amalgamation of ground truth (GT) and remote sensing (RS) approach. In addition to this, we validated field-measured aboveground net production (ANP) with remotely sensed SPOT-Vegetation data. ANP of the sites ranged from 6.8 to 11.1 and 3.3 to 8.8 t-C ha-1 year-1 for GT and RS, respectively. Both estimates (GT and RS) were linearly and significantly related with each other (y = 1.33x - 5.82, R 2 = 0.93, P = 0.04; where x = GT ANP and y = RS ANP). For the whole region, total NPP (rice + wheat) was ranged from 7.9 to 12.5 t-C ha-1 year -1. The C accumulation potential of the present agroecosystems was 9.1 and 1.9 t-C ha-1 year-1 in the form of ANP and belowground NPP (BNP), respectively. The aboveground C stock of agroecosystem allocated in foliage (7.8 %), stem (57.6 %), and grain (35.1 %). Survey about the fate of post-harvested materials indicated that aboveground portion of the crop is almost used completely within the year for different purposes including human consumption and cattle feeding. Therefore, only BNP and litter contribute to long-term C sequestration. Since agroecosystem has enormous potential to sequester C, better management of aboveground portion NPP of the crop may enhance C sequestration potential of agroecosystem. © 2014 Springer International Publishing.","Agroecosystem; IGP; NPP; Root C density; SPOT-Vegetation; Vindhyan highlands","Carbon; Crops; Greenhouse gases; Metals; Remote sensing; Vegetation; Agro ecosystems; IGP; NPP; SPOT-Vegetation; Vindhyan highlands; Ecosystems; carbon; aboveground production; agricultural ecosystem; carbon sequestration; greenhouse gas; ground-based measurement; net primary production; remote sensing; rice; soil carbon; soil organic matter; SPOT; upland region; vegetation cover; wheat; agroecosystem; article; bioaccumulation; carbon allocation; carbon sequestration; carbon sink; carbon storage; ecological procedures; foliage; grain; grain yield; ground truth estimation; India; net primary production; nonhuman; plant litter; plant stem; remote sensing; rice; soil property; wheat; Gangetic Plain; India; Vindhyan Plateau; Bos; Triticum aestivum; Agriculture; Animals; Carbon; Carbon Sequestration; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; India; Oryza sativa; Plant Stems; Soil; Triticum","English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84904016506

The formulation and implementation of policies to achieve such reductions requires an understanding of current and historic land-use change and associated greenhouse gas emissions. In addition, it is often proposed that any reduction in emissions be measured against a reference scenario that describes future land-use in the absence of intervention. However, the information needed to progress this agenda is rarely available, as robust data on the extent and causes of land-use change, and the associated changes in carbon stocks, are sparse, particularly in African woodlands. Here we present a novel method for obtaining such information by combining data from radar remote sensing and ground surveys with a simple aspatial model. Using this approach we quantify changes in woody biomass and investigate the land-use activities that caused these changes in a 7500km2 area of Manica province, Mozambique. We use the data to construct a model linking the activities causing biomass loss to hypothesised drivers, allowing the definition of future scenarios. Within the study area, biomass was lost at a rate of 2.8±1.9% per year, with stocks changing from 19.4±0.9TgC in 2007 to 17.6±0.9TgC in 2010. Small-scale agriculture was the direct cause of 46±17% of the total biomass loss, followed in magnitude by construction and miscellaneous activities (24±11%), charcoal production (18±9%), logging (9±5%) and commercial agriculture (3±2%). Uncertainties remain on the biomass accumulated by regrowing vegetation. Extrapolating into the future, a scenario that includes projected population growth shows 41% of biomass being lost from 2010 to 2020 (a loss of 7.2TgC). A scenario of intensive policy interventions gives reduced losses of 3.8TgC by factoring in improvements in crop yields, charcoal production efficiency, and sustainable timber harvesting. Our case study demonstrates the importance of low intensity losses of biomass in African woodlands, and highlights the broad range of activities that will need to be addressed to develop locally appropriate mitigation actions. The simple modelling framework allows for the transparent creation of scenarios in data sparse areas, which could be used as local or national reference emissions levels under REDD+. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Charcoal; Deforestation; Degradation; Logging; Radar; Reference levels","biomass; charcoal; deforestation; emission control; logging (timber); population growth; radar; remote sensing; timber harvesting; Manica; Mozambique","English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84902983237

However, rates of SOC increase can vary depending on cropping system, climate, and soil type, making the quantification of carbon change difficult on a regional level. Various long-term trials and commercial sites throughout Queensland were used to compare rates of SOC change under CT and NT management in cropping soils, and to determine how climate and soil type interact to influence rates of change. It was observed that NT management was not capable of increasing SOC stocks under the crop-fallow rotation systems practised throughout Queensland, and was unlikely even to hold SOC stocks steady under current management practices. However, SOC losses under NT systems did appear to be slower than under CT, indicating that NT may slow SOC loss following a period of organic carbon input, for example, from a pasture ley. On a regional scale, biomass production (estimated through remote sensing), climate (specifically the vapour pressure deficit), and soil sand content could be used to adequately predict SOC stocks on commercial sites, indicating the importance of considering these factors when assessing SOC stocks following management change across the region. © CSIRO 2013.","Climate; No-till; Organic carbon stocks; Sand content; Stubble retention; Vapour pressure deficit","Climate; No-till; Sand content; Stubble retentions; Vapour pressure deficits; Agriculture; Soil surveys; Soils; Vapors; Climate change; agricultural management; carbon sequestration; cropping practice; management practice; organic carbon; pasture; soil organic matter; soil type; tillage; vapor pressure; Australia; Queensland","English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84876425862

Then we model the effects of agriculture on soil air carbon flows and carbon sequestration. Incorporating fertilizer recommendations and pesticide use models we calculate their quantities utilized and efficiency ratios. Finally we calculate economic outcome, impact and identify areas prone to change to and from agricultural production in the study area using the cost models given by Virginia Cooperative Extension publications.

Results and Conclusions: The total estimated soil organic carbon stock in Croatia for all CLC categories relevant for the LULUCF sector (93% of the total country area in 2006) is 618,77Mt. Forests and areas with natural vegetation with 348,11 Mt contribute most of all categories, of which managed forests (broad-leaved, coniferous and mixed) contain 241,93 Mt and other natural vegetation classes 106,18Mt. Estimated soil carbon stock in agricultural land is 270,46 Mt, of which 166,99 Mt contain classes of intensive agriculture (arable land, permanent crops and complex cultivation patterns). Total change in SC stock between 1980 and 2006 equals +1,91 Mt and is mostly due to changes in agricultural practices in rural areas (abandonment of intensive grazing and conversion of pastures into natural grasslands). Changes in the forestry sector during the considered period were less noticeable but were also present, particularly for broad-leaved forest class (-2,73 Mt C). Trends of SC stock changes in LULUCF categories represent good indices of demographic and socio- -economic processes in Croatia where three distinctive momentswere evident: (I) decrease of SC stock in the 1980-1990 period mostly due to urban sprawl; (II) increase of SC stock in the 1900-2000 period due to the decline of agricultural activities in rural areas during and after war period; (III) decline of SC after 2000 due to more intensive urbanization and infrastructural development.",,"organic carbon; soil organic matter; article; bulk density; carbon footprint; Croatia; factual database; forest; forest soil; forestry; greenhouse gas; land use; nonhuman; pedogenesis (soil); remote sensing; rural area; soil analysis; soil carbon density; spatial soil variability; urban area","English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84888363149

Ground based hyperspectral data collected for wheat crop residue was analyzed using Stepwise Discriminant Analysis (SDA) technique to select significant bands for discrimination. Out of the seven best bands selected to discriminate between matured crop, straw heap, combine-harvested field with stubbles and soil, four bands were from SWIR (1980, 2030, 2200, 2440 nm) region. Six spectral indices were computed, namely CAI, LCA, SINDRI, NDSVI, NDI5 and hSINDRI for crop residue discrimination. LCA and CAI showed to be best (F > 115) in discriminating above classes, while LCA and SINDRI were best (F > 100) among all indices in discriminating crop residue under different harvesting methods. Comparison of different spectral resolution (from 1 nm to 150 nm) showed that for crop residue discrimination a resolution of 100 nm at 2100-2300 m region would be sufficient to discriminate crop residue from other co-existing classes. © 2012 Indian Society of Remote Sensing.","Best band selection; Residue; Spectral indices; Stepwise discriminant analysis (SDA)","agricultural management; agricultural soil; crop residue; data acquisition; data set; harvesting; soil erosion; soil organic matter; spectral reflectance; spectral resolution; straw; Triticum aestivum","English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84878801520

Although the consequences of soil quality reduction are generally recognized, the spatial extent of soil degradation is difficult to determine, because no universal equation or soil quality prediction model exists that fits all ecoregions. Furthermore, existing soil organic C (SOC) models generate estimates with uncertainties that may exceed 50%. Therefore it is possible that drastic changes in soil quality may be occurring in sites which are not identifiable on existing maps. Soil quality can either be directly inferred from SOC concentration, or through the assessment of the soil physical, chemical and biologic properties. Assessing the spatial distribution of SOC over large areas requires the calibration and development of models derived from laboratory or field based techniques. However, mapping SOC concentration in all soils is logistically challenging by using normal standard survey techniques. The availability of new generations of remotely sensed datasets and geographical information system (GIS) models (i.e. GEMS, RothC, and CENTURY) provides new opportunities for predicting soil properties and quality at different spatial scales.

However, the estimation of net GHG changes from mitigation practices in agricultural wetlands is complex compared to dryland crops. Agricultural wetlands have more complicated carbon and nitrogen cycles with both above- and below-ground processes and export of carbon via vertical and horizontal movement of water through the wetland. This letter reviews current research methodologies in estimating greenhouse gas production and provides guidance on the provision of robust estimates of carbon sequestration and greenhouse gas emissions in agricultural wetlands through the use of low cost reliable and sustainable measurement, modelling and remote sensing applications. The guidance is highly applicable to, and aimed at, wetlands such as those in the tropics and sub-tropics, where complex research infrastructure may not exist, or agricultural wetlands located in remote regions, where frequent visits by monitoring scientists prove difficult. In conclusion, the proposed measurement-modelling approach provides guidance on an affordable solution for mitigation and for investigating the consequences of wetland agricultural practice on GHG production, ecological resilience and possible changes to agricultural yields, variety choice and farming practice. © 2013 IOP Publishing Ltd.","agriculture; carbon sequestration; greenhouse gases; low-budget; measurement; modelling; remote sensing; wetlands","Agriculture; Budget control; Carbon; Estimation; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Measurements; Models; Remote sensing; Tropics; Agricultural practices; Carbon sequestration; Greenhouse gas production; Horizontal movements; low-budget; Remote sensing applications; Research infrastructure; Research methodologies; Wetlands; agricultural land; agricultural practice; carbon emission; carbon sequestration; crop yield; drainage; dryland farming; ecosystem resilience; estimation method; flooding; greenhouse gas; humid tropics; nitrogen cycle; numerical model; remote sensing; wetland","English",Review,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84876198822

However, the problem remains of how to quantify these gains. This article considers current greenhouse gas (GHG) quantification methods that can be used in a landscape scale analysis in terms of relevance to areas dominated by smallholders in developing countries. In landscape scale carbon accounting frameworks, measurements are an essential element. Sampling strategies need careful design to account for all pools/fluxes and to ensure judicious use of resources. Models can be used to scale-up measurements and fill data gaps. In recent years a number of accessible models and calculators have been developed which can be used at the landscape scale in developing country areas. Some are based on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) method and others on dynamic ecosystem models. They have been developed for a range of different purposes and therefore vary in terms of accuracy and usability. Landscape scale assessments of GHGs require a combination of ground sampling, use of data from census, remote sensing (RS) or other sources and modelling. Fitting of all of these aspects together needs to be performed carefully to minimize uncertainties and maximize the use of scarce resources. This is especially true in heterogeneous landscapes dominated by smallholders in developing countries. © 2013 IOP Publishing Ltd.","climate change mitigation; greenhouse gas; landscape; smallholder agriculture","Climate change; Developing countries; Climate change mitigation; Greenhouse gas (GHG); Heterogeneous landscapes; Intergovernmental panel on climate changes; landscape; Landscape-scale assessments; Quantification methods; Sampling strategies; Greenhouse gases; accuracy assessment; carbon emission; carbon flux; census; climate change; developing world; ecosystem modeling; environmental legislation; farmers attitude; greenhouse gas; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; landscape; remote sensing; resource use; smallholder; uncertainty analysis","English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84876196476

At the same time image data of the test site was acquired by the hyperspectral airborne scanner AISA-DUAL (450-2500 nm). The image data was corrected for atmospheric and geometric effects and a spectral binning has been performed to improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).

Remote sensing approaches have been investigated to obtain the crop residue cover (CRC) over large areas rapidly and objectively. While Cellulose Absorption Index (CAI) is a reliable indicator for crop residue cover estimation, it can only be applied to hyperspectral sensor, which usually has a narrow swath width. A new approach utilizing the shape of the spectrum of consecutive bands of MODIS data was introduced to distinguishing soil, crop residue and live crops. Since Landsat 5 TM's band configuration is similar to MODIS and provides fine spatial resolution (30 m) for agriculture in China, it offers an opportunity to assess crop residue cover over large areas. The objective of this research is to evaluate the Landsat-based angle indices for estimating CRC. Four spectral angle indices were derived by surface reflectance of Landsat TM. The results showed that shortwave angle slope index (SASI) is an ideal index for crop residue cover estimation. Simple linear regression reveals a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.7895 between measured CRC and SASI for the calibration dataset and RMSE of 0.0886 between measured and predicted CRC for validation dataset.

Although shifting cultivation is a dominant practice in several developing countries, there is still very limited information available on how to monitor this land-use practice for REDD+ as little is known about the areas of shifting cultivation or the net carbon balance. In this study, we propose and test a methodology to monitor the effect of the shifting cultivation on above-ground carbon stocks. We combine multiyear remote sensing information, taken from a 12-year period, with an in-depth community forest carbon stock inventory in Palo Seco Forest Reserve, western Panama. Using remote sensing, we were able to separate four forest classes expressing different forest-use intensity and time-since-intervention, which demonstrate expected trends in above-ground carbon stocks. The addition of different interventions observed over time is shown to be a good predictor, with remote sensing variables explaining 64.2% of the variation in forest carbon stocks in cultivated landscapes. Multitemporal and multispectral medium-resolution satellite imagery is shown to be adequate for tracking land-use dynamics of the agriculture-fallow cycle. The results also indicate that, over time, shifting cultivation has a transitory effect on forest carbon stocks in the study area. This is due to the rapid recovery of forest carbon stocks, which results in limited net emissions. Finally, community participation yielded important additional benefits to measuring carbon stocks, including transparency and the valorization of local knowledge for biodiversity monitoring. Our study provides important inputs regarding shifting cultivation, which should be taken into consideration when national forest monitoring systems are created, given the context of REDD+ safeguards. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Cultivated landscapes; Forest intervention; Land-use dynamics; Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation; Remote sensing analysis; Shifting cultivation","aboveground biomass; biodiversity; carbon sink; deforestation; developing world; emission control; environmental monitoring; forest ecosystem; greenhouse gas; land use change; monitoring system; quantitative analysis; remote sensing; satellite imagery; shifting cultivation; tracking; traditional agriculture; Bocas del Toro; Palo Seco Forest Reserve; Panama [Central America]","English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84868192386

C dynamics has been identified as a key intermediate or support ecosystem service that is profoundly altered by agricultural practices. The temperate grasslands of Argentina, the Pampas, are one of the main crop production regions of the world. Crop sequence, tillage and fertilization change inputs and outputs and, consequently the whole C dynamics. Our objectives in this article were (i) to provide a spatially explicit characterization, based on remotely sensed data, of crop sequences and tillage systems in the Rolling Pampas, (ii) to evaluate changes in C gains by computing the absorbed photosynthetic active radiation (APAR) from NDVI data of different crop, (iii) to evaluate the soil organic carbon (SOC) balance of different management schemes (crop sequence, conventional tillage vs. no till and three levels of nitrogen fertilization) using the CENTURY model, and (iv) to estimate the changes in SOC at a regional level. The results showed that 54% of the area was under continuous agriculture, with only two crop rotations occupying 61% of the area, and the main tillage system was no-tillage (73% of the area analyzed). Annual APAR was lower in crops than in rangelands, except for wheat-soybean double crop. Based on CENTURY simulations the crop management which had a most negative SOC balance (SOC reference value (100%)=79tha -1) was crop sequence ""maize/soybean"" under conventional tillage and with no fertilizer application (37% losses of SOC in 60 years). The management that presented the most positive SOC balance was ""soybean/wheat-soybean double crop (6 years) pasture (4 years)"" under no till and with high fertilization (10% increase of SOC in 60 years). A positive and linear relationship was found between APAR estimates derived from satellite data and simulated SOC providing basis for a quantitative hypothesis on the importance of C inputs on SOC's dynamics.

Thus, this study aimed to use the Century 4.0 model associated with geoprocessing and remote sensing techniques to evaluate the effects of agricultural use and soil management changes on dynamics of soil organic carbon (SOC) on farms in Santana (Ijuí, RS, Brazil). A geospatial database of the thematic plans: soil classes, land cover, landforms and beginning of agricultural use, were created in ARCGIS 9.x. After land use and soil management systems had been reconstituted from historical and current surveys, the model was initialized with local soil and climate data and calibrated in two steps. In the first calibration step, internal model parameters based on maize, wheat and soybean biomass C additions to the soil were adjusted, as well as SOC measured in 2007 (0-20 cm layer) of native forest (original condition) and an adjacent farm, where agriculture had been initiated between 1901 and 1930 (older plantation, area 1), sampling an Oxisol, on hilltops. Afterwards, the Century model was statistically validated based on data from 10 fields, initiated at different times, with the same soil type and landscape, sampled in 2007 (0-20 cm layer) divided into four homogeneous areas (Areas 1, 2, 3 and 4) within the district of Santana. In the calibration for generalization, four ""subtropical forest "" options were created to represent the native forest of each soil type in (Oxisol, Mollisol and two Entisol types) based on the tropical forest option generated in the primary calibration step; the adjustments of this step were maintained and only the parameter related to maximum gross monthly production of forest biomass was changed to stabilize the output variable SOMTC (simulated SOC), after running the model for 3000 years (equilibrium run), matching the measured SO C stocks of each soil type under native vegetation. After calibration, all possible combinations of soils, landforms, land use cover and land use change for the agricultural use of Santana ((1901 to 2007; 54 simulation units) were simulated by the i-Century interface. The model estimated the C dynamics adequately, reproducing the evolution of SOC stocks in the area. According to the estimates, the adoption of conservation management practices ensures the reduction of C losses caused by erosion and microbial decomposition, resulting in increases in SOC stocks.","Carbon modeling; Management systems; Soil organic matter; Spatially explicit dynamic modeling",,"English; Portuguese",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84865203412

In Iowa and much of the Midwestern United States (US), the typical management decision is to rotate corn and soybean crops for a single field; therefore, the land-cover changes each year even though the total area of agricultural land-use remains the same. The price for corn increased from 2001 to 2010, which increased corn production in Iowa. We tested the hypothesis that the production increase was the result of changes in crop rotation in Iowa using the annual remote sensing classification (the cropland data layer) produced by the United States Department of Agriculture, National Agricultural Statistics Service. It was found that the area planted in corn increased from 4.7 million hectares in 2001 to 5.7 million hectares in 2007, which was correlated with the market price for corn. At the county level, there were differences in how the increase in corn production was accomplished. Northern and central counties had little land to expand cultivation and generally increased corn production by converting to a corn-corn rotation from the standard corn-soybean rotation. Southern counties in Iowa increased corn production by expanding into land that was not under recent cultivation. These changes affect the amount of soil carbon sequestration. © 2012 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).","agriculture; biofuels; Conservation Reserve Program; corn; economics; ethanol production; land-cover classification; land-use change","Agriculture; Biofuels; Carbon; Crops; Economics; Forestry; Land use; Remote sensing; Rotation; Conservation reserve program; corn; Ethanol production; Land cover classification; Land-use change; Cultivation","English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84904414011

We conclude that it is possible to obtain GPP using only data of vegetation indexes estimated with remote sensing.","Caatinga; Ecosystems; Reflectance; Spetroradiometry","Agriculture; Carbon; Climate change; Dynamics; Reflection; Remote sensing; Vegetation; Caatinga; Carbon dynamics; Correlation analysis; Global climate changes; Gross primary production; HyperSpectral; Micrometeorological stations; Micrometeorological towers; Multiple regressions; Multispectral remote sensing; Observation data; Pernambuco; Plant canopies; Reflectance data; Spetroradiometry; Study areas; Terrestrial ecosystems; Vegetation cover; Vegetation index; Ecosystems","English",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84871783999

Remote sensing provides a quick, objective and efficient tool for measuring the amount of crop residue in the field. The relative position of stubble creates a layer of complexity in remote sensing in addition to distinguishing the crop residue against the soil background. The objective of this study was to estimate crop residue cover and amount for both standing and laid flat stubbles, and between two winter wheat harvest methods (i.e. stripper-header and conventional header) using a select Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and hyperspectral-based indices. Data collected from plots in Colorado include hyperspectral scans, crop residue amount (by weight), and residue cover (by photo-grid). Mean analyses, correlation tests, and spectral signature comparison showed the relative position of the crop residues affected the values of some remote sensing indices more than harvest management. However, there was inadequate evidence to support the use of these indices to accurately estimate the amount of residue. This information will be useful in analyzing remotely sensed data, especially for soil and water conservation across different landscapes.","Crop residue; Hyperspectral index; Remote sensing; Residue cover; Spectral estimate; Standing stubble; Thematic mapper; Wheat stubble","Agriculture; Digital storage; Estimation; Remote sensing; Soil conservation; Soil moisture; Water conservation; Crop residue; HyperSpectral; Residue cover; Spectral estimate; Standing stubble; Thematic mappers; Wheat stubble; Agricultural wastes","English",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84871781662

The Caatinga comprises a huge biological diversity. However, there are few studies to identify their ability to fix carbon what make then even more necessary in the context of climate scenarios projected for the end of this century. The study objectives to compare relationship between vegetation indices: Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Chorophyll Index (CI) with GPP. We used a plant canopy in a preserved area of Caatinga biome and then we calculated the vegetation indices. The results showed that CI (r2 = 0.92) has a higher correlation with GPP than NDVI (r2= 0.20). This result is an agreement with other surveys conducted recently. Then, we concluded that the rate of chlorophyll has shown to be optimal for GPP estimation.","Climate and regression model; Spectral response; Weather station","Agriculture; Chlorophyll; Estimation; Regression analysis; Remote sensing; Caatinga; Canopy chlorophyll; Climate scenarios; Gross primary production; Normalized difference vegetation index; Plant canopies; Regression model; Remote sensing techniques; Spectral response; Vegetation index; Weather stations; Vegetation","English",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84871759388

However, most research, pilot-REDD+ projects and carbon certification agencies have focused on deforestation and there appears to be a gap in knowledge on complex mosaic landscapes containing degraded forests, smallholder agriculture, agroforestry and plantations. In this paper we therefore review current research on how avoided forest degradation may affect emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) and expected co-benefits in terms of biodiversity and livelihoods. There are still high uncertainties in measuring and monitoring emissions of carbon and other GHG from mosaic landscapes with forest degradation since most research has focused on binary analyses of forest vs. deforested land. Studies on the impacts of forest degradation on biodiversity contain mixed results and there is little empirical evidence on the influence of REDD+ on local livelihoods and tenure security, partly due to the lack of actual payment schemes. Governance structures are also more complex in landscapes with degraded forests as there are often multiple owners and types of rights to land and trees. Recent technological advances in remote sensing have improved estimation of carbon stock changes but establishment of historic reference levels is still challenged by the availability of sensor systems and ground measurements during the reference period. The inclusion of forest degradation in REDD+ calls for a range of new research efforts to enhance our knowledge of how to assess the impacts of avoided forest degradation. A first step will be to ensure that complex mosaic landscapes can be recognised under REDD+ on their own merits. © 2012 Taylor & Francis.","Biodiversity; Deforestation; Forest carbon; Forest degradation; Governance; Greenhouse gases; Livelihoods; Monitoring; Mosaic landscapes; Remote sensing","biodiversity; carbon emission; deforestation; development project; emission control; environmental monitoring; environmental planning; environmental research; governance approach; greenhouse gas; ground-based measurement; landscape change; remote sensing","English",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84866876240

Monitoring the effects of applying organic amendments requires that topsoil organic carbon (SOC) content be spatially assessed. Within the framework of the French Gessol3 Scientific Call (Prostock project), this study aims at estimating SOC contents using point sampling data over the peri-urban surroundings of Versailles (France),covering a large peri-urban area (221 km2) characterized by cereal cropping systems and contrasting soil types. It also aims at spatially quantifying prediction error uncertainties, in order to compare them with those obtained through remote sensing estimation methods. Our data consist of common quantitative soil variables (physical and chemical properties, soil texture) and soil types at 141 point sites, and a digital elevation model. The various estimation methods must deal with many missing data. Specific pedological knowledge was used to correct and model some variables. Our estimation methods were the following: spatialized linear model, and cokriging with external drifts. For each method, emphasis was put on assessing statistical estimation uncertainties. Results were cross-checked accordingly to the current year soil samples in the study area. The estimation results and uncertainties are discussed regarding to the variables included into the models, and compared with other works about cultivated regions of equivalent area. Predictions with the best models and variable sets result in validation errors in a similar range to those obtained with satellite-based models (?4-5 g.kg-1 at regional scale). © 2012 Taylor & Francis Group.",,"Composting; Digital instruments; Forestry; Geomorphology; Mapping; Organic carbon; Remote sensing; Soil surveys; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Textures; Uncertainty analysis; Digital elevation model; Estimation results; Organic carbon contents; Peri-urban agricultures; Physical and chemical properties; Remote sensing estimations; Spatial stochastic; Statistical estimation; Soils","English",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84866346585
